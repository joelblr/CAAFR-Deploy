The Psychology of Money,Placeholder,The Psychology of Money: A Paradigm Shift in Financial Literacy,5,"In a world brimming with financial advice, Morgan Housel's 'The Psychology of Money' stands out as a beacon of clarity and wisdom. It's not a book about investment strategies or complex financial models; it's a profound exploration of the human mind and its intricate relationship with money. Housel masterfully weaves together captivating anecdotes, historical insights, and psychological principles to paint a vivid picture of how our emotions, biases, and experiences shape our financial decisions. He debunks common myths and misconceptions, revealing the counterintuitive forces that often drive our financial behavior. The book's brilliance lies in its ability to transform complex financial concepts into relatable narratives that resonate with readers of all backgrounds. Housel's writing is engaging, insightful, and devoid of jargon, making it a delightful read for anyone seeking to improve their financial understanding. 'The Psychology of Money' is not a get-rich-quick scheme or a collection of investment tips. Instead, it's a journey of self-discovery, guiding readers to examine their own financial habits and make informed decisions based on a deeper understanding of their own psychology. Through Housel's lens, we learn that financial success is not solely about numbers and formulas; it's about understanding our own motivations, fears, and irrational tendencies. He emphasizes the importance of patience, discipline, and a long-term perspective in achieving financial well-being. The book is filled with thought-provoking quotes that capture the essence of Housel's philosophy. For instance, he reminds us, 'You don't have to get wealthy to be wise about money.' This simple yet profound statement underscores the importance of financial literacy and sound decision-making, regardless of one's financial status. In a world where financial anxiety and uncertainty are pervasive, 'The Psychology of Money' offers a refreshing perspective, empowering readers to take control of their finances and make informed decisions that align with their values and goals. It's a book that will stay with you long after you turn the last page, its insights subtly shaping your financial mindset and ultimately leading you towards a more fulfilling financial life."
The Psychology of Money,Amazon Customer,Don't delay the Read!,5,"I must admit, I came across this book a full four years later than I should have. Had I discovered it earlier, my entire perspective on spending, saving, and lifestyle choices would have undergone a change. Fortunately, this shift is now steering me in the right direction. The authors approach to personal finance is truly remarkable. Words fail to capture the depth of wisdom conveyed in these pages; you must experience it. He masterfully deconstructs the pitfalls of debt, emphasizing the importance of saving for the sake of saving, rather than for any goal. While some may interpret the tone as cautious or even warning in each chapter, this is simply a reflection of lifes ever unexpected shocks. If you are between the ages of 13 and 20, this book is an essential read. It will help shape your financial decisions, guiding you toward a more secure future. Even if you choose to take a different path, the insights in this book will reveal where that road may lead. And for those who have made financial mistakes, it offers invaluable advice on how to do the course correct, even later in life. For readers in their 70s and beyond, it still holds great valueyou can pass along its wisdom to your grandchildren, ensuring they start their financial journey on the right foot. In short, this is a life-changing book!"

The Psychology of Money,Aritra Sarkar,A good read on how to manage money,5,"4.5 Stars. A curveball by Morgan Housel. With a twist in the middle, this book opened certain viewpoints that changed my financial conceptions. Being from a third world country, My views regarding money were very much different. Still,money is a subject which every person in this world sees as an object of wealth, greed &amp; happiness. Hard work &amp; dedication is one of the main principles to it. What you get is how you think of it. Here are some aspects I searched out to be useful and actionable : &gt; Its never as good or bad as it seems in finance. Going out of your way to find Humility when things seem right and Forgiveness/Compassion when things go wrong is the way to find peace with money. Respecting the power of money mixed with luck and risk will help you focus on the things that you can control. To be honest -&gt; I am still to find it, I take calculated steps to find peace with my money. I am a bit whimsical when it comes to money. Need to control my urges &gt; Saving money is the gap b/w your ego and your income. Wealth is something created by suppressing the urge to buy now; so as to have more stuff in future. No matter how much you earn today, it wont create wealth unless you discard the thought of how much fun you can have with your money today. Save, just save. You dont need to a specific reason. &gt; Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. It is different for different people. Some wont sleep until they see higher returns on their money; for others it may be investing conservatively. To each their own. &gt; For every investor, the single most powerful thing is to increase the time horizon. It pushes results closer to what people deserve. We can be wrong half the time, and yet make a fortune. Its OK to be have lots of things wrong, youre human. Chillax. &gt; Using money to gain control over your time &amp; the ability to do that gives you independence. What you want, when you want, how you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend in money matters. &gt; Being nicer &amp; less flashy with money helps infinitely. No one elses as much impressed of your possessions as you are. What you most Want is Respect &amp; Admiration, which can ONLY be achieved by Kindness &amp; Humility, not horsepower and chrome. &gt; Defining the cost of success &amp; paying it is obvious coz nothing worthwhile comes free. Uncertainty, doubt &amp; regret are common costs of money world. We must view costs as fees, not fines. Getting one thing for another is a way of life in finance. &gt; Worship room for error is a conservative hedge that gives us endurance. It happens by the gap b/w what could happen in future versus what you think that should happen in future. Incentives are huge motivators in life. So, try to get more out of life. &gt; Avoid extreme ends of financial decisions at all costs helps us get over a feeling of regret as we evolve. All our goals &amp; desires change over time. In our childhood &amp; youth, we crave to consume. In our adulthood, we crave to consume and provide. In our retirement zone, we try to consume again. Consumption and Creation are parts of life. Minimize the wastage of money. &gt; Conservative risks taking help us, it pays off in time. Being reasonable, not overly rational, helps the most in our financial decisions. They are mostly taken, not in boardrooms or on spreadsheets, but at the dining table, with family. &gt; Define the game you are playing &amp; make sure your actions are not being influenced by others whore playing a different game. Keeping the ball in your court is crucial. Respect the mess coz smart &amp; reasonable people can disagree on your decisions, as they vary in their thought process."

The Psychology of Money,Samarth Sharma,Don't be in dilemma. Buy it!!!,5,"One of the best books in the ocean of self-help books scattered across the market. Don't be in a dilemma whether you should buy this book or not. Morgan Housel has written this in a very captivating and easy to understand language. Some points I would like to mention~ 1) It won't teach you how to be rich or how to generate more wealth. Instead, this book will teach you about the relationship you have with your money. After reading this book, you'll see money in an entirely different way. Perhaps, you will respect and value it more. You'll realise how crucial money is and how much should you have. What's the limit? Is it enough or not? How much risk should you take to earn more? These questions will be answered one by one as you'll read this book. 2) The language is very captivating. It keeps you hooked into the chapters. You won't get bored while reading it. Figures and numerical examples are shown in the book which never felt confusing at all. 3) The quality of the book is really good. The front cover is just It's fresh!!! It's smooth!! It is perfectly saturated!! And, it's clean!!! The little dent you see on the lower left of the front cover is because of my mishandling. :-P Amazon delivered it very well. I had no complaints while receiving this. 4) It's not too long. You can finish it within a few days. The main part is that author isn't repetitive at all. Generally, self-help books' authors goes this way only. They'll bombard you with information thousand times over and over again in the course of 200+ pages. I faced this problem when I read 'The power of your subconscious mind.' So, props to Morgan Housel here for keeping it limited and to the point. That's my conclusion. If you want to buy the book. Definitely, you should. As, James Clear, the author of 'Atomic Habits' have himself said on the cover ~ 'Everyone should own a copy.' And, it's not an exaggeration. The book is really pleasing. It even looks good on your bookshelf. XD"

The Psychology of Money,Milan,The best knowledge about money that you can get,5,"When your favorite financial writer comes out with a book, its okay to drop everything to read it. I've been a fan of Morgan Housel's writing for many years. The idea for the book 'The Psychology of Money' came from his long article by the same name. He likes to keep his writing concise but it packs a punch. The best part of his writing is that he takes the lessons from history, finance, psychology, etc. and applies it to everyday personal finance. He has this uncanny ability to look at something as everyone else and see something different in it. This book can be read very quickly, but the whole point of reading it is to stop and think about how these stories apply to our own behavior. He makes us think about our relationship with money. Our behavior impacts our financial success, more than intelligence or anything else. Wealth is not really about what others think about us, its more about using our money to control how we spend our time and live our lives. Investing isnt a race to be won; its a more of a test of our character. He examines personal finance through the lens of human behavior. A few gems in Morgan's own words: How you behave is more important than what you know about money. Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. Time is the most powerful force in investing. A small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes. Define the game youre playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game. There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. Savings that arent earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against lifes inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment. Endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, I can do whatever I want today."

The Psychology of Money,Siddharth Subramanian,The Psychology of Money - Short Stories teaching Big Lessons,5,"If youve always found the world of finance, investing, and money in general to be an uncomfortable thing that youd rather push under the rug than confront head on, then this book is for you! The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel is a book about money that, unlike most other finance self-help books, is not about teaching you how to get rich quick. It teaches you about money as a concept as well as giving you a sense of direction about how to think about money. It does so through 20 crisp and short lessons which are engaging in the different areas it covers and makes one think through its simple and sometimes counter-intuitive lessons! I wouldve appreciated a bit more detail on the stories mentioned in the book, like how luck in Bill Gates childhood played a major role in who he became. But I understand that it was a conscious choice made (Housel even mentions it in the introduction) to make all the lessons short and to the point. My favourite part is the chapter where he talks about how Wealth is what you dont see. This chapter details out the difference between being wealthy and being / looking rich and it genuinely made me re-evaluate what I really wanted from life! I think the best quote to both sum up the book as well as the reason why you should pick it up is : Financial success is not a hard science. Its a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know."
The Psychology of Money,Tirth Patel,The main point is that we are complicated creatures who have complicated relationships with money.,5,"This was a short but enjoyable read. The main point is that we are complicated creatures who have complicated relationships with money. It's ok and expected to not base every decision off of cold Excel calculations. Instead of pretending we will, here is some of the advice he recommends: Don't try and time the market. Dollar cost average. 85% of large cap fund managers did not beat the S&amp;P 500. Stock picking isn't the worst thing ever but know the odds are not in your favor. Doing some of that is OK but you should primarily stick with low cost index funds. Always keep an eye on greed creeping in. Make sure to avoid the psychological treadmill of keeping up with the Joneses. Investing a lot when you're younger is so important. The vast majority of Warren Buffett's wealth is because of how early he started investing, more so than having a higher rate of return. compounding is a wonderful thing. Wealth usually ends up being more about how much money you save rather than how much you earn from your job or the right investments. Saving is the gap between your income and your ego. Having money saved gives you flexibility in many facets of life and immeasurable peace of mind. It allows you to do what you want, when you want it. It's OK to do something that gives you peace of mind even if it's not the best financial decision. For example, finishing student loan payments with a 4% interest-rate even though you could make more by reducing payments and investing some of that in the market. Expect the unexpected when it comes to the stock market, and don't pull out monev durina downturns. Have a 1/3 buffer. For example, if the Indian stock market usually returns 6.9% after inflation, prepare for 4.6%. You may retire in a bear market or the past may not repeat itself. To the point of not trying to time the market: only 9% of tactical mutual funds, those that try to re-allocate stock versus bond percentage based on economic forecasts, ended up doing better than just leaving it in. Enduring downturns is the cost of compounding, and it's well worth the price. Think of market volatility as a fee. You get what you pay for. Remember that people, especially the media, tend to air on the side of pessimism even if things usually get better over time. All things considered, I would recommend this book!"

The Psychology of Money,Shruti A Chhabra,A must read for everyone,5,"The Psychology of Money. I have been meaning to pick up this book for most of 2021. Something prompted me to pick it up as the first read of 2022. I started this book thinking it would be an out-and-out technical investment sort of book. Since I am not from an economics background, I had decided that I would close it down if I felt that it was too technical. It wasn't easy to put it down as I started reading it. There are specific terminologies that I found hard to understand, but as a layperson, I could grasp ninety-five percent of it and how. It covers almost all aspects regarding money and wealth in twenty comprehensive chapters. The book changed my perspective of investment. There are specific quotes that are my favorite from the book. I want to share them. Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose. No one's crazy: Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. Doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. Money is everywhere; it affects all of us and confuses most of us. I love Voltaire's observation that 'History never repeats itself; man always does.' It applies so well to how we behave with money. We all do crazy stuff with money because we're all relatively new to this game, and what looks crazy to you might make sense to me. But no one is crazywe all make decisions based on our own unique experiences that seem to make sense to us in a given moment. Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need. Good investing is not necessarily about making good decisions. It's about consistently not screwing up. Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking the risk. It requires humility and fear that what you've made can be taken away from you just as fast. In the last chapter, Morgan Housel shares with us how he has invested his money and his saving methods. The book is an absolute gem. I feel everyone must read it once in their lifetime. Housel has made complicated subjects like money saving and financial investments in simple yet effective words. Highly impressed."

The Psychology of Money,Placeholder,Valuable insights into the behavioral aspects that influence individuals,5,"The Psychology of Money' is a compelling book written by Morgan Housel that delves into the complex relationship between psychology and personal finance. The book offers valuable insights into the behavioral aspects that influence individuals' financial decisions and perceptions of wealth. Housel's engaging narrative combines real-life anecdotes, historical examples, and psychological research to provide a comprehensive understanding of how human behavior shapes financial outcomes. Through various anecdotes and case studies, Housel emphasizes that personal finance is more about managing behavior and emotions than simply understanding numbers. He highlights the significance of concepts such as the impact of luck, the role of financial habits, and the importance of developing a long-term perspective when it comes to wealth accumulation. One of the key takeaways from 'The Psychology of Money' is the emphasis on the importance of adopting a prudent and mindful approach to financial planning and decision-making. Housel emphasizes the need to prioritize financial stability and security over the pursuit of extreme wealth, advocating for a balanced and sustainable approach to managing one's financial life. Overall, 'The Psychology of Money' serves as an insightful guide that challenges traditional views on wealth and encourages readers to reevaluate their relationship with money. It provides readers with a deeper understanding of the psychological factors that influence financial behaviors, encouraging them to make informed and responsible decisions to secure their financial future."

The Psychology of Money,Very good product,Everything,5,Mind blowing book
The Psychology of Money,Tushar,Great insight!,5,"The book teaches how to think about money and life in general. It tries to tell us that we need to decide what we want and we would find out that most of the times it's doesn't require any complex planning, just the regular old stuff - frugality and patience with a bit of knowledge."
The Psychology of Money,MCube_slade,world is actually big and we are just a blip in it,5,"See guys this book is for those who have had a lot of Thier skin in the game of stock market and thought of creating wealth from it. First level of investor is the one who knows money can be made in the mkt, but doesn't know how and starts to trade without any knowledge. Second level investor have made profit or loss on his capital and starts to find out where did he has gone wrong and starts learning about some basic concepts such as PE ratio. Third level of investor starts finding value in whatever the scrip he has been following and starts finding justification that it is costly or cheap and buy or sell them. Fourth level investor follows and checks if the price have gone up or not very often and loses faith if it doesn't go up after he bought it, and if price doesn't go up he sells it and looks for another one.in a short span of months. Again goes back to drawing board and finds what went wrong. Then come the whole talk of buffetology and starts to find companies like that and invest in them if he felt that it was cheap. But everyone forgets that buffet is buffet because of his principles and patience which helped him in compounding for very long time such as 70-80 years which very few do it. That's when actually psychology matters and thats what Morgan tries to tell us in this book that more that analysis of the scrip, conviction that you calculated and the patience to hold it at least for several decades remains intact only then the wealth would be created or else you would be just a person among a crowd doing nothing but ordinary things in life. And explains that the world is actually big and we are just a blip in it. It gives us all a great humility and convinces us to be humble and show gratitude to others."

The Psychology of Money,Vivek Sharma,Why reading The Psychology of Money is a must for better understanding of Money,5,"I have read many books on personal finance, investments, money etc. but I have not come across a book as interesting as The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel. There are 20 chapters in the book and each one of them have their own valuable message. The book is interesting in many ways. First of all, it communicates many complex concepts in very simple terms. For instance, a concept like Bubble which is often discussed in the world of finance is described by Housel as The formation of bubble isnt so much about people irrationally participating in long term investing. They are about people somewhat rationally moving towards short-term trading to capture momentum that has been feeding on itself. This is just one example. The book is full of pearls of wisdom. There is nothing that can match a statement like The only way to win in a Las Vegas casino is to exit as soon as you enter. Let me come to some of the most amazing insights that the book provides. The book talks about difference between getting wealthy and staying wealthy. The author says that many people acquire wealth but fail to preserve wealth and hence it is important to learn how to preserve wealth. As per Housel, Preserving wealth requires humility, and the fear that what you have made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you have made is attributable to luck, so past success cannot be relied upon to repeat indefinitely. The author talks in detail about role of luck in investing at many places in the book. He quotes his conversation with Robert Schiller, winner of Nobel Prize in Economics, to whom he once asked, What do you want to know about investing that we cant know?. In response to this question Schiller said, The exact role of luck in successful investing. The author keeps on surprising with his wonderful understanding of money in different chapters of the book. But the exclusive chapter on saving, which is chapter 10, has many interesting aspects about savings. Emphasizing significance of savings, the author says The first idea- simple, but easy to overlook-is that building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate. He adds that you dont need a specific reason to save. He has also mentioned something which is an eye opener. Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego. The author also highlights the need for knowing what is enough, when it comes to money. In brief, you must read this book irrespective of how much you understand about money. There is something for everybody in this book."

Housel, a former investment manager, uses stories and anecdotes to illustrate the often irrational ways that people think about money. He also provides practical advice on how to make better financial decisions. One of the things that I liked most about the book is that it is not just about how to make money. It is also about how to use money to achieve your goals and live a happy and fulfilling life. Housel argues that money is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or for evil. It is up to us to decide how we want to use it. I would highly recommend The Psychology of Money to anyone who is interested in learning more about the psychology of money and how to make better financial decisions. It is a well-written and insightful book that will help you to understand your own relationship with money and how to use it to achieve your goals."

The Psychology of Money,Srikanth M.,Very relevant to Indian readers as well,5,"Most best-selling books on investing and personal finance are from the west (mostly US). With such publications, readers in India will need to do some sifting through and quite a bit of mental arithmetic before deriving value from the book. Rarely does a book come along that is readily accessible and relevant to the Indian audience. The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel is one such book. I heartily recommend it. Morgan distils the enduring wisdom about the relationship between people and their money in 20 chapters. Some of these chapters are about stocks and the market, but most of them are about people about the games they play with money. Each of these chapters can, as the author notes, be read individually as well. But they are not disjoint essays. Each essay pushes the narrative farther, and helps the reader to get a fulsome understanding of how the relationship with money works for people all the misconceptions about money and wealth and all the traps and pitfalls investors land themselves in time and again. That said, this book is definitely not a litany of donts. For every single admonition that the author makes, he points to the right way as well. The concepts themselves are simple and time-tested the role of luck in investing, why timing the market will not work over long periods of time, importance of patience, the right way to do planning and more. But Morgan writes about them with a straightforward clarity and with persuasive arguments, and always keeps it interesting. To illustrate the power of compounding, he goes all the way to the geology of ice ages. To show the power and importance of luck, he cites an example from the early life of Bill Gates. And he uses examples from his own youth to tell readers about how people perceive being rich. The most important point that the author makes is about why one should strive to build wealth why one should save and invest. If one reads the book and takes that single point to heart, it would have served its purpose. I would recommend the book especially to young people the sooner they understand these points, the better the rest of their lives would be."

The Psychology of Money,Dr. JITENDRA SHARMA,Plan on your plan not going according to plan.,4,"I was scouring Amazons vast library for a fiction to read, as it has been a while that I read a good whodunnit or its ilk. While searching, this book jumped up on suggestion list and as it was ordained, I just had a glance at its blurb and inhaled a whiff of its contents. I forgot, fiction for a while and within seconds I ordered it. Ordained. After having finished it - the following are my independent observations: A book for all seasons and plethora of reasons. A succint way of saying things which matters and doing it in a way that rises above the usual chatter. The author weaves his magical lessons through anecdotes and stories, he keeps the narrative interesting and grounded. He soars through his wit, wisdom and wordly take on the happenings around us. He makes us travel the whole of earth geography via the pages of world history. The lessons in the garb of stories and narratives are easy to comprehend and follow, the biggest plus of this work is the authors ability to speak the lingo of the reader - covering to whole continuum from low lying layman to loftily levitating learned. His ability of pick up tangled threads from our life-finances to straighten them up with minimum of fuss just takes us readers into an enlightening journey into personal as well as professional finances. To sum up the reasons to read this one are: amazing clarity about complex concepts; real, working but unheard mental models; simple and easy to grasp perspective; sanely sensible and insanely practical. A book for young to follow, middle aged to learn from and veterans to mull over. The best part of the book is that the author is unpretentious and has no grand illusions of his expertise and experience about money. It is an honest version of a man who believes in - no one knows right answers and humbly accepts it as the sole universal truth. I couldnt concur more. Dr. Jitendra Sharma Nagpur"

The Psychology of Money,Anand Gupta,It's not a book about investing,4,"This book is about grounding the investor into a broad reality without giving any tips on actual process of investing. Author has argued that investing is more about your psychology than what asset you're investing in, and if you understand self better, you can get away happier without much returns on your money. The key lesson for financial success- maintain a lifestyle well below what you can afford, so you never run out of money. I doubt many people would take that advice, especially when the whole world and their uncles seem to be on a perpetual treadmill of finding new pleasures, each of which require dollops of money."

I am a beginner in investing and this book has really given me a lot to think about. Especially the importance of the question, 'what do you aim to gain from investing'. Everyone will have a different answer to this question but the book guides you to really think about your reason and portrays examples where due to incorrect mindset, people have made bad decisions. I would recommend this to anyone who is thinking of starting investing, as after reading this you might have a better understanding of what you are looking to gain, whether it be short or long term."

But having read some of his posts on internet, I decided to buy this. It's really valuable if you're a new investor. If you're an experienced one, it is good to be reminded of a few things. I agree with one of the critisisms; it's all about USA. Not even one example from any other country. But I can't deny that those examples are good. And then there is a very long, boring post script about the history of US Economy,which is entirely pointless in the context of this book. This is not meant to be a history book. Unless you want to know about the history of US economy, never waste a minute on that post script. That is the most useless part of this book. Otherwise a good quick read."

The Psychology of Money,Anonymous,Good read but not relatable.,4,"This obviously is a great book and you certainly can learn a lot. But the only thing that dissatisfied me is the statistics, graphs, and various examples relating to the context are all extracted from US markets and events. And me being an Indian didn't find them quite useful. As you know the way money is treated and worked slightly differs from countries. Despite this, the nature of money remains the same all over the globe and this book teaches you that. Thanks for reading this review, I'm young and I can always be wrong, feel free to correct me."

The Psychology of Money,Kindle Customer,Good,4,"I like the author giving perspectives on both aspects of investing whether it is a crazy maniac one, or a passive monk. What I don't understand (maybe my assumption) is that the book did not lean into black and white like views which is a good thing. It needs to be read multiple times (that's what I think.)"
The Psychology of Money,ankush,Good book with authors life-long experiences,4,The psychology of money By Morgan housel is a great book not only about investing but also the journey of every single penny.

The Psychology of Money,Trupti,Nice book,4,it's a Knowledgeable book. ppl who want to understand money flow and how it works. should read once
The Psychology of Money,Placeholder,OK Book,4,"It was an insightful book but at some places, it becomes too preachy. Money impacts every person differently, and many times it's our decisions that decide the fate of our bank balance. But this book also considers luck to be a major factor in money-making. Luck is a factor but not to the extent to which this book claims. Having said that there are a few good lifestyle habits that are mentioned in the book. My personal belief and agreement are with the one where it says, we should not change our lifestyle with the change in salary. Definitely a true point."

The Psychology of Money,Sanjay Mohanty,The psychology of money,3,"The Psychology of Money' by Morgan Housel is a thought-provoking and insightful book that delves into the complex relationship between money and our emotions, beliefs, and behaviors. The author uses a combination of personal anecdotes, historical examples, and research findings to explore the psychological factors that shape our attitudes towards money and how those attitudes can affect our financial decisions. One of the key themes of the book is the importance of perspective and context in understanding our relationship with money. Housel argues that our perceptions of money are heavily influenced by the experiences and influences of those around us, and that a lack of perspective can lead to poor financial decisions. He also highlights the role of luck and chance in shaping our financial outcomes, and the importance of recognizing that success and failure are often the result of factors outside of our control. The book also explores the role of emotions in financial decision-making, and how our emotions can lead us to make choices that are not in our best interest. Housel argues that our emotional responses to money are often irrational and that we need to be aware of these emotions in order to make better financial decisions. Having studied behavioural economics in university and the works of Thaler and Kahneman I found this section particularly interesting. Another theme of the book is the importance of patience and long-term thinking in managing our money. Housel emphasizes the importance of setting financial goals, and the importance of staying the course in order to achieve them. He also stresses the importance of avoiding impulsive decisions and focusing on the long-term effects of financial decisions. Overall, 'The Psychology of Money' is a well-written and engaging book that provides a thoughtful and nuanced perspective on the relationship between money and our emotions, beliefs, and behaviors. The author's use of personal anecdotes and historical examples makes the book highly relatable and accessible to a wide audience. The book is recommended for anyone interested in understanding the psychological factors that shape our attitudes towards money and how those attitudes can affect our financial decisions."
The Psychology of Money,Srinidhi,Good book but bit out of league for few Indians,3,This book is good only if you understand stockmarkets especially USA's. Honestly I couldn't connect much with this book but yes there some valuable takeaways.
The Psychology of Money,BROKEN PROMISES,Money is what we all want,3,Thanks to this book im a millionaire now . Greedier than ever and winning at life. : )
The Psychology of Money,Amazon Customer,The Psychology of Money: A Valuable Book on Money Management and Generation',3,"Valuable Insights: 'The Psychology of Money' is a highly informative book that provides a wealth of insights into money and its management, as well as strategies for its generation. Fact-Based Approach: The author skillfully bolsters their ideas by incorporating numerous facts, enhancing the credibility and reliability of their arguments. Slight Conservatism: While the book offers valuable perspectives, some readers may find that it leans slightly towards a conservative viewpoint regarding money handling and generation. Room for Diverse Approaches: It is worth noting that there are multiple ways to handle and generate money, and some readers might seek a broader range of approaches beyond those presented in the book. Overall Assessment: 'The Psychology of Money' remains a valuable resource for understanding the intricacies of money management and generation, but readers should keep an open mind and explore additional perspectives to develop a well-rounded understanding."
The Psychology of Money,Rahul Chandrasekharan,Hindsight Comprehension,3,"Easy to read and composed of small chapters. Highlights: - Reflects on what we've been doing with money so far, ironically it points out that we can't rely on history - When dealing with the equation of money emotions cannot be ruled out. Hence have our emotions in check while dealing with money - There is no outright rule that works for all. To each their own."
The Psychology of Money,Sureshkumar Anbazhagan,Advanced one - Not for beginners,3,"I couldn't understand many terms, which are related to stock ,sensex exchange ect., Te book requires a prerequisite knowledge of investment, stocks for effective comprehension."
The Psychology of Money,Kanwar Anand,Tedious Towards The End.,3,"The book has a lot of relevance as it is divided into 20 small chapters. The author hopes you retain any one of these lessons in your quest of independence. I feel the book has affected my outlook but for how long I really wonder. Largely what the book says is that there is a lot of greed in the world. There is also a bottomless pit in us and most people should know and ascertain how much is enough. Also if we all just invest money in a stock or an index and forget about it, there is 99% chance we shall be successful in a decade or three. But this is all easier to say than to do. Most investors can get shaky and sell. They get restless. The key is to let compounding do its own trickery. This book also preaches saving, determining a moderate lifestyle and continuing on that irrespective of your revenue soaring. This will help you invest the gains back into other investments. It also talks about how having a cash flow is good for always being ablle to invest 'when' the opportunity presents itself. REVIEW CONTINUES.. The last quarter of the book made me restless. The stories started being uninteresting and repetitive. I wanted the book to end. This does not usually happen to me so I think the last quarter was tedious. You may read it but if you miss it, that's ok too. What other books? 'unshakeable' by Tony Robbins"
The Psychology of Money,Majid Nazir Ganie,Disappointed with the packaging,3,"The book is amazing , the quality of paper is great but the packaging is disappointing. Amazon needs to improve the quality of packaging especially for the books."
The Psychology of Money,Rishmal,Bad shipping,3,"Book cover and page qualities are good, but due to shipping the book was minorly damaged outside."
The Psychology of Money,Amazon Customer,Okayish,3,"I would say this is just okayish. It teaches the same old principles of having patience &amp; reasonable expectations to build wealth over time, just like most other finance books."
The Psychology of Money,Placeholder,Too much hype,3,"Yes many things are important which are recorded in this book, but whole book can be summarised into less than 100 pages, some chapters were unnecessary. Most of the chapters are related to invest and stock market, title of book is deceiving."
The Psychology of Money,Chaitanya Sethi,"I don't get the hype, sorry",3,"Featuring 19 anecdotal chapters that tap into the emotional aspect of our relationship with money, the book does little except offer stories that can all be summarized in this format - 'People's reaction to (chapter theme) could be X but it could also be Y', which is my least preferred takeaway format from any book. The trouble is, nothing that he says is wrong. It's just inconclusive. And so, no aspect of my attachment to money - as a medium of exchange, a symbol of status, a storage of security etc. was modified as I turned the last page, which made for a reading experience the equivalent of a shoulder shrug. I realized later that it was the case because I had already read books on the same theme - 'How to worry less about money' by The school of life, and Timeless simplicity by John Lane. I suppose this is the first book that most people are reading on this theme and that could explain the extremely high rating because it is baffling otherwise. I give it 3 stars but this book falls strongly in the category of - 'this could've been a crisp podcast episode.'"
The Psychology of Money,Rahul Nagar,Book's quality,3,Book is not properly glued.
The Psychology of Money,Amazon Customer,Good,3,"Good book, well written"
The Psychology of Money,Ranjeet Barsa,Good,3,Good
The Psychology of Money,ASK,Only the first few chapters worth reading,3,"It starts off as a good guide to personal finance, but past the 30~40% mark, it seems like the author is just encouraging you to invest in, and stay invested in the stock market. Wealth-building requires sound decision making in all spheres of life, and I was expecting the author to explore these very inter-dependencies. To the author's credit, there are a few good nuggets around this in the initial chapters, but not covered in as much detail. Also, in today's skills based economy, you can build wealth faster by acquiring/refreshing relevant skills than the return you earn on invested capital, but sadly, the author makes little or no reference to this. Jaded references to the same handful of famous American investors cause a nauseating feeling. Reading such books from American authors can give you an impression that all great people/companies existed ONLY in America, and that their contemporaries in the rest of the world were just bozos !"
The Psychology of Money,Amazon Customer,Hard to read.,3,Subject heavy
The Psychology of Money,Vishal,missing pages,3,few pages are missing...few are duplicated
The Psychology of Money,sahil kumar sahu,QUALITY OF THE BOOK IS NOT GOOD,3,The Seller is responsible for the quality of the book but yeah its okay if you can ignore the quality and focus on the content and another thing is that you can request for the replacement so don't hesitate to order it but the quality of the book can be better for the price we pay for sure.

The Psychology of Money,Yogesh Bagri,Paper quality,3,The media could not be loaded. The book is no doubt is a good read. My concern is only with the quality of the pages. Pages are very thin very poor quality. You can go for hard cover as price differnce of paper back and hard cover is not much.
The Psychology of Money,Abhijith Ravindra,Received an old book! Works like lucky draw i guess.,3,"Even though the offer states not 399( MRP) it's 177, i was hoping for a new one. But received an old one. Probably used by 3-4 people. But anyways, it's a book so I don't wanna complaint much about the quality."
The Psychology of Money,Dark_Knight,Average Read.. Nothing extraordinary,3,"The book did not offer much novelty in terms of financial advice. It dealt more with articles on how people thought about money. It is no comparison to other great books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad. It's an average read."
The Psychology of Money,Mukta Ahelleya,The book itself is best but the packaging was the worst possiblw,3,I like the book but my problems are with it's packaging the book is damaged and I think it's a 2nd hand book or something (buy at your own risk) the price was 174 INR by the way.

The Psychology of Money,Brijesh lahon,Mostly on investment rather than psychology of money in human nature,3,"The book mainly focuses on investment rather than money's impact on psychology of human. The reader should be interested in stock market and should know the terms of finance, if not interested in stock market don't buy this book &amp; it mostly gives examples related to U.S which becomes hard to recognise from other parts of the world &amp; at last the cover of the book is not so new it has some scratches."
The Psychology of Money,K Unt Al,Might be enjoyed by beginners.,3,"This book might be enjoyed by people who have no idea about the topics, but people who are familiar with works of Daniel Kahnmann, Richard Thaler, Nassim Nicholas Talib (which mostly used as the source material of the book) will find it cliche. The name is little misleading too, this is in no way a psychology book, this is an pure self-help book. Only advise is save and save and invest in index funds, and wait. Meh!"
The Psychology of Money,Shivani,Didnt resonate.,3,The type was small for my eyes if I remember correctly. And it had nothing which was of value to ME. Maybe Ill reread and change my review.

The Psychology of Money,Paramveer singh,Too basic,3,"It's for teen agers,not for adults.cause everything here is optimisation which is minimal risk in life type.so,I haven't really liked this book cause everything I had known before I read this book. Book says about savings,compounding,risk minimisation,rational thinking,luck and long-term planning.i would recommend this to the childs and for teens but not for adults.dont waste your time."

However, not rating it 5 stars since the quality of the book provided by Cloudtail is poor with pages torn as per the attached picture. Since I realised that after the return window closed, couldnt replace it. Please check when you buy!!"
The Psychology of Money,Subramanian Seshadri,Just an average read.,3,If you are just embarking on financial planning this book may excite you but people in their 30s or 40s would have learnt the lessons the author talks about in this book. There is nothing new in the book that has not been told by many others.True some chapters are good but just a few of them. On one level it is full of cliches and financial stories we have already heard often.
The Psychology of Money,Vijaya Lakshmi,One time read (Not really value add for top Bschool MBA Alums),3,It is a much hyped book I would say. I meanw hat author told makes sense but anyone who did an MBA from top Bschools know most of these things already. It is most of what we already learnt in our MBAs ..so I haven't got much value addition by readin this . Also this is from US context ... So may be if it was in Indian context the relatability would be better
The Psychology of Money,Ramakant,Binding and paper quality is not good,3,The book was delivered on time but the paper quality is not good. I am afraid that the binding and pages in tear down after some time.
The Psychology of Money,Arshad,Bad packaging,3,Product is ok as far as print and paper is concerned but the packaging was terrible.

The Psychology of Money,Sanket Mohapatra,Simple workable advice,3,A good read on self finance strategy. Its unnecessarily lengthy to pass few key points across. Last 2 chapters is what effectively required to read and understand.

The Psychology of Money,Yuvaraj,Not a book review,3,This is not about content in the book. It's all book the quality of the book that I have received.

The Psychology of Money,ritu moitra,It may feel like a repeatation or re-confirmation at times,3,"Average read, most of the things mentioned are passed down from generations to indian children by parents. Ofcourse stock investment is something additional but warren buffet had established it too as a wealth creation method. Good book for those who are in their 20s and starting fresh"
The Psychology of Money,Ng GopendroSingh,Just an average book,3,Expected a lot. But less stuff on psychology was presented. Money should have been a common topic. The relevance of money and psychology could have been explained much better. Ideas on investing and hence compounding are much talked about. It could have been better if the book dicusses the effects money has over human psychology. 3 STARS..

The Psychology of Money,Ved Malve,Disappointing Printing Quality,2,"The media could not be loaded. I was excited to get my hands on 'Psychology of money' but unfortunately, the printing quality significantly impacted my reading experience. The pages were thin and yellowish, giving the book a cheap and possibly pirated feel. Thin, Yellowish Pages Detract from Reading Enjoyment. The thinness of the pages made it feel like I could rip them easily, and the yellowish tint gave the book an aged appearance. This detracted from the overall aesthetic and made reading less enjoyable."

The Psychology of Money,Amazon Customer,Not for Indian Market!,2,"The message conveyed by the book is good but I don't find it fit for Indian economy. 1. For example books say to invest at an early age of teenagw but do any of you earned money till 23/24s? 2. Nothing on Mutual funds. 3. Nothing on Indian stock risks I do agree that this is not what one should expect from the book but my point is instead of investing your time in this invest your time to understand Mutual funds, Market risk mitigation plans, savings ( strictly as per our economy ), regulatory bodies and thier functions etc"
The Psychology of Money,Deepak kumar,Boring and uninteresting for the readers who had studied pshycology,2,"Book is confined to the people with sheer interest in investment like stock market ,funds or stock trading etc. It should be named as psychology of investers. It fails to mention how the scarcity of money or its abundance has influenced ones social and psychological behaviour and how it had influence the culture transitions along with structure of political system throughout ages."
The Psychology of Money,Ivana Edwards,Irrelevant to the new-age and asks you to live a frugal life.,2,"So I am halfway through the book and I am finding it a struggle to continue. Firstly, its overtly hyped! Every other person I know is preaching about this book, which makes me wonder: Do people not know the basics of finance? This book talks more about investing, saving and becoming wealthy than the psychological aspect of money. Which, btw, is not a new subject. Atleast for me. I had high expectations from the book. I expected it to change me in someway. But my biggest takeaways were to save all the money, live a frugal life, invest consistently without letting the highs and lows of a market affect you, and strive to be wealthy, not rich. Which again, NOT NEW! Moreover, I am sure author would have become a lot wealthier if he would have gotten a dime every-time he mentioned Warren Buffet. Back to the book, the author has tried to make the chapters small so that you get through it faster. But all I have been doing is to mindlessly read through the parts just to get done with it. And believe it or not, it has a lot of grammatical errors too! Being a copy editor, I couldnt help but notice the number of errors this book has. Anyway, long story short (which the author should have done), you could easily skip this book without missing out on something big!"
The Psychology of Money,PARVEEN,NOT SO GOOD,2,Avg book. There are better books available with much simpler language and explanations in my opinion.It felt like somehow the author got a peek into our personal lives.
The Psychology of Money,SUBHRAJIT,NOT SO GOOD,2,"OK, I didn't like this. common not so special, There's a lot of people with global wealth, a lot of connections, a lot of ways to make money, and I think that's what this book is about."
The Psychology of Money,Sharmistha,A heap or ledger assembled from many sources,2,History is full of facts. numerous people and each with tons of experiences. All the people and their learnings are wonderful. This book is a heap or ledger assembled from many sources. No creative insight from the author to snowball.

The Psychology of Money,Amazon Customer,Should have just been a blog rather than a book.,1,"This book reminded me of how I used to keep elaborating my answers in my school tests if the question was for 16 marks. There is so little content but so many words. I understand that this was originally a blog that was later turned into a book because of the popularity. This is a neat business gimmick that will bring financial gain to the author; good for him. But speaking purely about the joy of reading a book, I will not recommend this to anyone. This is one of the few books I couldn't get myself to finish. However, I have to admit that there is one good thing that came out of this book for me. I am now going to be wary of books in the market that are based on blogs, YouTube videos and podcasts."

The Psychology of Money,anirban,Nothing that you already know,1,"If you have read thinking fast and slow, and any of Taleb's books, you do not need to bother with this. Yes, you should invest in stock markets with a long time frame for best results, yes you should save as much as you can, and yes, more than showing off wealth by buying things, your should be the freedom that wealth allows you. But these are obvious. These days bestsellers are manufactured, I guess the right publicity can make anything top selling."

Rich Dad Poor Dad,Milton,Great,5,"April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published,readers will find that very little in the book itself has changed and for good reason. While so much in our world is changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad havent changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosakis international bestseller are more timely and more important than ever. Milestones: While there is a milestone to commemorate and a new section in the book on Why Milestones Are Important preserving the integrity of the original content is testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have been updated again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents those who embraced Roberts story and messages 25 years ago are sharing them with new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyones life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances. People of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons weve learned, and celebrate accomplishments and they give meaning to our lifes journey. They are a way that we integrate past, present, and future looking back at where we started, where we are today and the promise of all that the future can hold. In the quarter century that has passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published 25 years since April 8, 1997 so many things in our world have changed. But the one thing that has not changed is the pressing need for and the power of financial education. Money is still a mainstay of our lives,like it or not, and technology has brought both speed and innovations to the world of money. In an ever-changing world, we can all still get smarter when it comes to money and learn as much as we can to secure our future."

Rich Dad Poor Dad,Placeholder,Rich Dad Poor Dad: A Transformative Guide to Financial Empowerment,5,"In the realm of personal finance literature, Robert Kiyosaki's 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' stands as a landmark publication that has challenged conventional financial wisdom and empowered millions to take control of their financial destinies. First published in 1997, the book has sold over 32 million copies worldwide and has been translated into over 51 languages, cementing its status as a global phenomenon. At the heart of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' lies a simple yet powerful message: the rich don't work for money; money works for them. Kiyosaki, a self-made entrepreneur and financial educator, contrasts the teachings of his highly educated but financially struggling 'poor dad' with those of his wealthy, entrepreneurial 'rich dad.' Through engaging anecdotes and relatable stories, Kiyosaki highlights the importance of financial literacy, emphasizing the need to acquire assets rather than liabilities, and to understand the difference between working for money and having money work for you. He encourages readers to challenge conventional financial thinking and embrace the entrepreneurial mindset, emphasizing the power of investing and building wealth through passive income streams. While some critics have challenged the veracity of certain aspects of Kiyosaki's personal financial journey, the book's core message remains as relevant and empowering today as it was when it was first published. 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' has served as a wake-up call for countless individuals, inspiring them to reevaluate their relationship with money and take steps towards achieving financial freedom. The book's impact extends beyond the realm of personal finance. It has ignited a global conversation about wealth creation, financial education, and the importance of entrepreneurial thinking. Kiyosaki's teachings have resonated with individuals from all walks of life, providing a roadmap for those seeking to break free from the shackles of financial struggle and take control of their financial futures. 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' is not without its flaws. Some critics have pointed out inconsistencies in the book's narrative and questioned the practicality of certain financial strategies advocated by Kiyosaki. However, these criticisms do not diminish the book's overall message of financial empowerment and the importance of taking personal responsibility for one's financial well-being. In conclusion, 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' stands as a transformative guide to financial empowerment. Kiyosaki's unconventional approach to financial education has challenged traditional thinking and inspired millions to adopt a more proactive and entrepreneurial mindset towards wealth creation. While the book may not provide a foolproof formula for instant riches, it undoubtedly serves as a valuable resource for those seeking to break free from financial constraints and achieve financial freedom. The book's enduring popularity and global impact are a testament to its power to inspire and transform financial lives."

Rich Dad Poor Dad,Mohammed Aarif,Rich dad poor dad book,5,"Comes with fine packaging, good one to understand basics about money"
Rich Dad Poor Dad,Anirban Das,Must Read,5,"Talking about personal finances is often avoided despite its importance in our lives. Over the years, our have value systems have ingrained in our minds that thinking about money is equivalent to being greedy which is far from the truth. It is high time we overcome misconceptions and understand the importance of growing or at the very least (literally) maintaining the value of money we have as it is virtually impossible for anyone to work throughout their lives for money after a certain age. For those who are willing to take steps towards understanding the importance of money and personal finance, Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki is one of the books, I would recommend to start with. Written in a language that can be understood without any prior knowledge of finance, the book very systematically explains the importance of 'financial Intelligence' and getting out of the 'rat race' by making money work for us instead of the other way round. Although the concepts are based on the author's own life experiences which predominantly includes investments in the real estate sector, they are quite universal. Out of the many arguments put forth in the book which I mostly agree with, the most important one as per me is that 'financial education starts at home' as it shapes the mindset of an individual for lifetime. Luckily, mine started at an early age during dinner table talks with my dad."

In simple words I will tell you the impact the book has created on me :- Before reading this book I wanted to buy a luxury car on loan from my salary, after and in fact by the time I had half read the book I have started buying assets and cash flow that support my pay for the car.."
Rich Dad Poor Dad,Pankaj Bhalavi,best book ever was read,5,"The book is written in a conversational style, with Kiyosaki sharing stories from his own life and the lives of his two fathers. He argues that the traditional view of money, which is to work hard and save for retirement, is a recipe for financial disaster. Instead, he advocates for a more active approach to money, where people learn to invest and build wealth through assets. Pros: Easy to read and understand Entertaining and engaging Provides valuable insights into personal finance Can help people to change their relationship with money Cons: Simplistic views of money Lack of academic rigor Some of the advice is outdated Can be seen as self-serving"

Rich Dad Poor Dad,Prashant P.,"A Book that challenges you, if you have been working for money all these years.",5,"What the author is saying makes a lot of sense. It requires a huge guts for a middle class person to think in those terms. However, once this thought comes across, one will be much happier--because the most difficult part of financial management of a middle class person is, indeed, how to make the money work; so that the person can breathe easy, tired and exhausted as he is, trying hard to work for money, and more money."

Thank you Robert T. Kiyosaki for changing my life"
Rich Dad Poor Dad,Mirudhulla Neelakandan,Good buy(investment),4,Good quality book. Unused. Posting a honest review from my perspective this particular book alone has to be read by everyone who needs to know how to manage their asset column. This will make your eyes open with unusual quotings which are actually meaningful and will make you think about it. You may or maynot take steps immediately after finishing this book but guys you will definitely think about starting something to grow your asset column. Go ahead and buy this book ! WARNING : This book might be misleading if not understood properly before converting your earning income into passive income.
Rich Dad Poor Dad,Lavanay,Good Book. You learn from it.,4,"What this book teaches is to take job in initial years to gain knowledge and not for salary. Keep expenses low and invest salary in assets (Real Estate if you are in US). Then start working for yourself. Start a business or use the money saved to work for you by means of investing in commercial real estate or stocks. Avoid purchasing home, car, with salary. Buy them later after your money is working for you. Once youre a big businessman, then avoid paying taxes by making corporations and hiring top accountants and attorneys who will help you in this. The book keeps you interested and you wont feel bored."

Rich Dad Poor Dad,Gurpreet Singh Rainu,Learn to make smart investment decisions to build wealth.,4,"Rich Dad Poor Dad is a personal finance book written by Robert Kiyosaki. The book advocates for financial independence and wealth-building through investing, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one's financial intelligence to improve one's business and financial aptitude. The book is written in the form of a parable, with Kiyosaki telling the story of his two 'dads' - his biological father, who was a highly educated but financially struggling school teacher, and his best friend's father, who was a self-made millionaire. The book offers practical advice on how to increase one's financial literacy and make smart investment decisions to build wealth."
Rich Dad Poor Dad,sudheesh,This is f*****financial book,4,Understand the Asset and liability or become a slave to the money.it will show you why middle class struggling for a surviving and middle class buys liability then they got nightmare .
Rich Dad Poor Dad,Byreddy Trinadh Reddy,Rich Dad Poor Dad,4,"Rich dad poor dad is one of the most popular self-help books ever written. It was written by Robert Kiyosaki a well-renowned investor, to let the world know how they can gain finical knowledge and live a life without worrying about money. This book is best for beginners who want to attain finical freedom"
Rich Dad Poor Dad,Sarthak jha,challenges conventional notions about wealth and financial freedom,4,"Robert Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad Poor Dad is enlightening and provocative, challenging preconceived notions about money and financial success. Kiyosaki recalls his early memories and the lessons he acquired from his two fathers in this personal finance classic: his friend's father (the 'rich dad') and his own father (the 'poor dad'). Kiyosaki teaches important lessons about how to amass wealth and achieve financial independence through these divergent viewpoints. This book's ability to demystify difficult financial ideas and make them understandable to readers from all walks of life is one of its strongest points. The idea of assets vs obligations is introduced, the value of financial knowledge is emphasised, and adopting a mindset centred on creating passive income is encouraged by Kiyosaki. These ideas are provided simply, making it simple for one to comprehend and apply them to one's own financial journey. Rich Dad Poor Dad also contradicts the widely held notion that the only ways to achieve financial success are through a decent education and a well-paying job. Instead, Kiyosaki advises readers to become financially literate, make investments in assets that will generate income, and adopt an entrepreneurial mindset. This book challenges conventional wisdom and challenges readers to view money differently."
Rich Dad Poor Dad,Surjivala Keval,Rich dad poor dad,4,"Rich Dad Poor Dad' is a personal finance book written by Robert Kiyosaki that focuses on the importance of financial education and building wealth. The book tells the story of Kiyosaki's two dads: his biological father, who was a highly educated but financially struggling government employee, and his best friend's father, who was a wealthy entrepreneur with little formal education. Kiyosaki highlights the differences in mindset and financial literacy between his two dads and how those differences impacted their financial success. He emphasizes the importance of developing financial intelligence and understanding how money works in order to achieve financial freedom. The book is divided into ten chapters, each of which covers a different aspect of personal finance, such as the importance of saving, investing, and building assets. Kiyosaki also explores the concept of financial leverage and how it can be used to create wealth. One of the key takeaways from the book is the importance of financial education and taking control of your own financial future. Kiyosaki argues that the traditional education system does not teach people how to become financially independent, and that it's up to individuals to seek out the knowledge they need to succeed. Overall, 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' is a valuable read for anyone interested in personal finance and building wealth. While some of the advice may be controversial and not suitable for everyone, the book provides a thought-provoking perspective on money and financial success."

The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,Samarth Sharma,The only review you need to read!!!,3,"The only review you need to read to decide whether you should buy this book or not. So, it's a slightly long review but this will help you a lot if you are buying any book for the first time after being fascinated by a lot of bestsellers. I will tell you in the most simplest manner. If you think something, constantly feed your brain with some information and tasks. Later, the subconscious works upon it and turns it into a reality. That's it! That's the whole point of this book. Nothing else. For example : If you have a stage show tomorrow but you have stage fright. Then, before going to sleep, constantly feed your brain that - 'Nothing bad will happen. I will rock the stage. I don't have any stage fright. I am the most confident person in the world.' Imagine yourself giving the speech with utmost confidence. And, then tomorrow guess what...!? Yeah you performed well. This is the thing that author talks about. The book is so repetitive that I barely managed to read 16 chapters out of those 20 chapters. At first I thought it would be a scientific study. You might be thinking that as well, right? Oh, hell no!!! This is anything but scientific study. The author just gives you examples from the early centuries to modern day happenings that this is how xyz person performed well in his studies. This is how the girl pqr found her ideal husband. He never goes into the science. According to him, whatever you will feed your subconscious mind, the subconscious mind will start acting on it and it will present you the results. So, what's the problem with this book? 1) It's too repetitive. It was my first book and even as a first book I couldn't get past 16th chapter. I have 7-8 self help books currently on my bookshelf. And, this is the one I like the least. 2) I have already told you the core idea. Nothing else is there in the book which might help you. I basically presented you the whole book in just a sentence. On the other hand, author decides to write 200+ pages. 3) This books is written in such a clever manner that people don't even pay attention to it. The author uses Bible's verses and phrases here and there after each 2-3 page and connects it to the power of your subconscious mind. It's like author is trying to make you read Bible. I mean, I don't have any problem exploring other religion's book. But, what's the need here? It feels like author wrote this book in a view that everyone is a follower of Christianity. If I really want to read these phrases, I can read them in the Bible. However, author connects some phrases with some examples in order to tell you that this is what Lord Jesus meant. There is not even 1% scientific explanation about this method. Although, I have yet to believe on this method. I'm trying it in my day to day life. The author fails here to explain how it happens. He just tells you that the power of our subconscious mind interferes with the laws of the world and manifests your desire in the real world. However, there isn't any scientifically sure answer to this. For example : You went to a shopping store. You saw a set of jwellery. You wanted it badly but it was too expensive. You kept dreaming about it. The thought is presented to the subconscious mind. Later, after a few days or weeks someone from your family gifts that same jwellery set to you. You see how it was done? There's no correct answer to it. Some may call the power of subconscious mind. Some may call it the grace of the god. Some may prefer that it was a coincidence. And, it keeps going on. My conclusion? You don't have to buy this book. Trust me! You can listen it on kindle but a hardcopy? No! Definitely not! Also, if you're like me who just found out that you're a bibliophile. Stay away from buying this book. The quality of the pages were not good. The page bleed and my highlighter is visible on the next page. Use pastel colour highlighters if you really want to underline some lines. Srishti book publications couldn't live up to my expectations. This book is cheap. Seeing that you'll be too happy that such a good bestseller is available at such a cheap price. But dear, so is the quality. Pages are so bad. I can't even compare them to my other books that I've purchased. Always... Always first give a look at the publisher. Rupa, srishti publications offers you books at cheaper prices but with cheaper quality. Consider buying from some big houses. Like, penguin, hachette, HarperCollins, Jaico, etc. These are Indian publishing brands as well. You can go for them blindly. I have told you everything you need to read. It's upto you now whether you still want to add this book to your bookshelf or not. P.S - The bookmark in the picture is of my own. Of course! Amazon doesn't provide you any free bookmarks. ()"

Atomic Habits,Amazon Customer,Book,5,Nice book
Atomic Habits,Ramij Khan,Bought this book from a book fair and not Amazon,5,"The book amazon delivered was a duplicate copy. And since I wanted to read it very badly, I bought it from a book fair. Now coming to the book, it is simply amazing and life changing if followed with discipline. It is relatable and engages from the beginning with its simple to understand writing style. This is a book which caters to all kinds of readers. The book is based on 4 rules of habit that explain how we perform our habits and how they are formed. It is explained that a habit is based on 4 things: cue, craving, response and reward and these 4 aspects works on a cyclical basis to make sure we repeat that habit again and again. It mainly focuses on the effects of small habits. It mentions how if we get one percent better each day, we'll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year (1 % better every day for one year: 1.01 = 37.78). Conversely if we get one percent worse each day for one year, we'll decline nearly to zero (1% worse every day for one year: 0.99= 00.03). It also contains useful tips on how to break bad habits. Overall it is a great book and go for it if you have decided to read it."

If u want to buy a book and read just close your eyes and start this, that will be one of the best decision you will ever take. Highly recommend."
Atomic Habits,AV,A terrific book on habit building.,5,"This is a great book to help you achieve anything you might set your mind on that requires consistent work. James Clear sets out clearly (as it were) why habits and important and how to develop wholesome, effective habits. The book is full of quotable quotes: 'You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems'. 'Forget about goals. Focus on systems instead'. 'You get what you repeat'. 'Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits'. 'The score takes care of itself'. 'True behavior change is identity change'. And many others. The idea it'd seem is simple and ought to be obvious; and yet, our failures with our life-projects show that we don't appreciate them enough. The contents of this book ought to be taught in classrooms. They're that good!"

Atomic Habits,Aruna Thiruvenkataraj,Unlock Your Potential,5,"Although I bought this book years ago, I recently had the pleasure of reading this gem and I must say that it exceeded my expectations. From start to finish, this book provided me with invaluable insights and practical techniques that have truly motivated me to take control of my life. One of the best aspects of this book is how easily relatable its contents are. The author has a remarkable ability to connect with readers on a personal level, making the concepts and ideas accessible to anyone. The use of straightforward language and clear explanations ensures that even complex topics can be easily understood and implemented. What sets this book apart is its emphasis on actionable techniques. The author doesn't just present theories and concepts; they provide readers with tangible tools to apply in their daily lives. I found myself constantly bookmarking pages and jotting down notes, eager to put the techniques into practice. Whether it was setting goals, managing time effectively, or resolving procrastination issues, each chapter offered valuable advice that I could immediately implement. The delivery of the book was smooth. The author's writing style is engaging and keeps you captivated from page one. The chapters flow seamlessly, building upon each other to create a comprehensive guide to personal development. I appreciate how the book combines practical advice with real-life examples and anecdotes, making it relatable and easy to connect with. Furthermore, it delves into the psychological aspects of personal growth, which I found to be truly enlightening. It explores topics such as mindset, self-belief, and overcoming obstacles, providing deep insights into the human psyche. The psychological aspects discussed in the book are wonderful to learn, as they offer a fresh perspective on personal development. I wholeheartedly recommend the book to anyone seeking personal growth and self-improvement. It's a must-read that has the potential to be a life-changing tool. The book's motivational tone, relatable content, and practical techniques make it suitable for individuals from all walks of life. No matter where you currently stand in your journey, this book will provide you with the guidance and inspiration you need to unlock your full potential."

Atomic Habits,Placeholder,Marvelous book,5,"The concept, illustrations and continuity of the plot is very good."
Atomic Habits,siddique,Printing is clear,5,"I found this book on Flipkart for a low price of 200. However, the review image shows missing letters (half/part of the letter print is disappeared) and a different number of pages. And also, I found the same book and publisher on Flipkart for a low price of roughly 230 rupees for two books, but I'm not sure how the print was, and I noticed few missing letters on the pages while viewing the review images. I needed a book with clear text to utilise for lifelong learning, so I ordered it from Amazon. I read a few pages and saw only one little ink dropout on Forget About Goals (zoom in the letter O on page 23). I check over the pages. It's tough to find ink dropouts. Everything is clearly printed and makes it easy to read."
Atomic Habits,Venugopal Muthyala,Practical and usable gospel on self help,5,"I have left many a self-help book read partially, having realised the impracticability in terms of invoking and imbibing any of their recommendations! Atomic Habits by James Clear, sets itself apart from all such self-help books by highlighting how small, meaningful and concrete steps can and do add up to helping one succeed with ones targeted goal, or vision. More importantly, the templates it provides one to actually start implementing the ideas it espouses, is the key reason that one should take up reading this wonderful literary creation. Thank you, James!"

Atomic Habits,Abhishek Rakhecha,4 Lesions I learnt from this Book,4,"1. Don't set Goals : Writer kehte he ki goal set karne ki bajay ek system pe focus karna chaiye Goals set krna achi bat he lekin us goal ko achieve karne k liye system ko behtar banana padega jo hame us goal tak pahuchayega. Agar British Cycling team ki bat kare to gold medal jeetna to unka goal shuru re raha tha, lekin Dave ne jab system ko better banaya, to goal apne ap achieve ho gaya. Maan lijiye apka room bikhra pada he. Ap ek goal set krte ho ki mujhe room clean karna hee to ek bar room clean ho jayega, lekin agar ap apni chijo ko sahi jagah rkhne ki adat bana lo to apka kamra kabhi bikhra milegha hi nai. 2 Change your Identity : Apni buri adato ko change krne ke liye hame adto ko chang karne s pehle apne aap ko change karna ki jrurt hoti he . Hamari adte hamari identity ko follow krti he . Example k liye Man lijiye ek insan cigarette chodne ki koshish krta he . Is douran jab use koi cigarette offer karta he to vo ye kahta he nahi yar, me cigg chodne ki kosis kar raha hu Usnea bhi tak apni identity nahi badli. Vo apne ap ko abhi bhi smoker manta he. Lekin, agar vo ye kahe ki nahi yar, me cigg nahi pita is se vo apni identity change kar leta he. Ab vo apne ap ko non smokere consider karta he . This new identity motivates that person to stick with it. 3 Change your Environment - Hamare sath akshar esa hota h ki ham kitchen me jate to paani pine k liye, lekin hamari nazar chips k packet pe padti he or ham use khane lagte he . Hairani ki baat ye he ki hame na to bhookh lagi thi or na hi chips khane ki ichha hui thi. Malls vale yahi technique use krte he, mehange or profitable products racks me upar or ankho ki range me rakhi jate he jo customer ko easily notice ho jate he . And chances are that customers in products ko jrurt na hote hue bhi kharid lete he. Isi technique se ham bhi kisi bhi habit ko abopt kar skte he ya kisi bad habit ko chord bhi skte he. Fruits jyada khanee h ? to fruit basket ko vaha rkho jaha ap apna din ka sabs jyada time spnd krte ho. Jab fruits apki ankho k samne rahnge to ap automatically unhe consume krne lag jaoge. Padhai krt krte distract hote h to padhai k liy alag room, ya room me alag table ko study zone bana do. Yani padhai bed pe nhi usi enviorment m kroge, to apka mind kam distract hoga qki usko pata h k aap study zone m ho. 4. Dont run for the best: Ek choti si interesting si story share krta hu. Florida University ke ek professor ne apne photography students ko 2 groups me divide kiya. Pehle group ko yeh challenge diya ki unko pure semester jyada se jyada photos submit karne he , 100 photos submit krne vale ko A grade, 90 vale ko B. Or dusre group ko challenge diya to submit only 1 photo but that has to be the perfect one. Jiska photo sabse perfect hoga usko A grade, or us se kam vale ko B grade milega. Interesting. At the end of the semester saare best photos surprisingly first group se aye. Aap bhi soch rahe honge k esa kese hua, dusra group jisne pura semester ek photo ko perfect krne me lagaya unke photos best rank me q nahi aye ? Because jaha dusra group ek hi photo ko perfect banana me laga raha, pehle group ne jab bahot sare photos click kiye to isi ke sath unki skills bhi enhance hoti rahi. Vo har photo me experiment karte rahe or apni hi mistakes se sikhte rahe. Agar apko business krna he ya startup krna he or best idea ya best opportunity k liye ruke he to ap kabhi start hi nahi kar paynege, Jo bhi idea he jesi bhi opportunity he uspe jab mehnat ki jayegi to vo hi best ban jayega."

Atomic Habits,Ajinkya B.,Good quality,4,Page quality is not worth of the price. But still the product is good.
Atomic Habits,Anshu Rai,Provides perspectives. Comes with tons of hands-on solutions/tools for habit formation/eradication.,4,"A book filled with all the pragmatic approaches toward habit building. All in all, the author has done a great job as the book hits the right spot from the very start. It provides a reader with various perspectives, provides handy solutions, charts, and tables to enable the habit forming process. With the book, the author has genuinely tried on providing every possible tool for a reader to sail through smoothly in the process of habit formation and sticking to it. The book does its job of making a novice understand the way mind works, comprehending the science of habit formation, and providing the ways to alter the pattern by creating new habits or deleting the existing ones. It is packed with the knowledge of psychology, or on the actual wiring of mind. Also, it brings references from the paleolithic age from time to time, and the author has done an exemplary work at making it all interesting, and easy to comprehend via graphs, and effortless writing. Also, the author has mentioned numerous examples from day to day life, and from the sports team we follow from, from the last Olympics games and more, to make the subject or the topic more relatable. When writing is concerned, there is a consistency throughout however, there are times when it becomes repetitive and dull. Hence, I have rated it a 4 on 5."
Atomic Habits,Anil,Must read for almost anyone,4,"The author shares valuable information. After reading Atomic Habits, I started doing things which were on my wish list for a long time. Feel like it's worth reading more than once. This book can be recommended to almost anyone interested in reading."
Atomic Habits,Rayapur Pradham,This is Why you should read it !!,4,"This book is beautifully written with practical examples by James clear. The way he connected the chapters with one another is something that is so special about this book. The chapters are short which you can complete in an hour each. The tricks that clear shares are easy to implement and are consistent driven. I have personally tried some of the tricks in my life and i have seen profound impacts of them. Every time I re-read it , there is something new. Hope this review helped you."
Atomic Habits,Kaveri,Quality,4,Great book good packing and delivery. The book in overall good condition the only problem I see is the page quality it is not very good but still it's not too bad you can adjust with it. I see many people rate the paper is too bad but it's not too bad it's adjustable. There's a problem with the outer cover once we use it it bends like an arch. The book is good if there's is a 4.5 option I'll give this book 4.5 overall
Atomic Habits,SUNNY BHATIA,Great Book !!!,4,This is a great book about how to change our unproductive behavior and how can we apply good habits in our life. I like the easy language in which this book is written. But it should be more easy for non English reader. I recommend this book to all.

Atomic Habits,Sreekanth P,A very good book to understand the basics of habit formation,4,A much recommended book to develop long lasting habits. Helps you understand some of the basics of either developing good habits or getting rid of bad habits. A lot of things in the book may seem sheer common sense. However the way it has been articulated and further buttressed with scientific facts is refreshing.
Atomic Habits,Varun Giri,Book quality was great but packaging was not good.... improvement needed in packaging,4,The book was in great condition....
Atomic Habits,Customer,Book,4,Good for students.. Self development book
Atomic Habits,Sam,Recommended for all.,4,Just started. Excellent. Experienced author.
Atomic Habits,yashwanth.E,"It's been a while, it's not the same somehow.",4,"(Since Amazon is forcing me to give a rating 4/4 for content (it's a bestseller and i am here to learn) and 0 for book quality) The paper quality is a big let down... The fun of reading a hand held book is in the way paper looks, feels and how legible the words are in the paper. The overall feel is kind of flimsy. I am not an avid reader. so, I can't really understand if this quality standard is the new normal. Last time I read something in a book it felt good to hold and paper quality was good. Just getting these things out of the way to focus on the content in the book. At first glance, it looks like there are no missing pages."
Atomic Habits,Ajinkya K.,Amazing Book. A must buy for everyone.,4,"Okay so the book got delivered today, received the book in an Amazon paper bag only there was no protection (Plastic cover or a box) whatsoever. The front cover was not in the best condition, the corners were a little bit chipped and slightly bent. With a few tweaks here and there I uh managed to flatten the corners. So the quality of book imo is 3/5 (could have been better). As for the contents of the book : The text is amazing, just the perfect size and font, no misprints and errors. The quality of the pages is amazing, they are neat and clean. The diagrams are pretty detailed and crispy looking. I'll revisit this review when I'm done reading through the entirety of the book."
Atomic Habits,Placeholder,Change,4,"Its a great book if to keep the price range in mind i bought it for 486 but 1 day before it shiwed 396 this was the only thing bad i felt, but quality is nice, it has great things"
Atomic Habits,Sushil Nair,We are simply creatures of habit !,4,I would recommend this book to anyone who would be enthusiastic to learn about human behaviour and what sets the winners from the rest of the mundane. Appreciated that the author has used simple layman's language and shared the tools to sustain good habits and the know how to avoid the bad ones. A word of caution - Dont expect that the book will share some magical formula to change oneself overnight. I believe that itself is folly however if one improves himself just 1% daily that would make him 36.9X times better exponentially. The beauty of compounding and this book explains exactly how one can build and design the system and environment. Beautifully explained why we do what we do.
Atomic Habits,asdfghjkl,Don't think too much read it,4,No matter who you are or what you do- you need this book. Read it- and then- read it again. Thank me later. It doesn't matter what other books you will read before and after this- but you don't want to miss this one.
Atomic Habits,ganesh K R,My Views!,4,"I believe, this is the book that talks about daily life situations what most of the people go through. Finding ways from daily habits and daily excercises make sense. We all have something special inbuild, we need only to recognize it. Nice book for youth."
Atomic Habits,Harleen,Amazing,4,Book was amazing u can give it a try
Atomic Habits,Ankush,Nice read,4,Nice read
Atomic Habits,sumeet,Adored it,4,"A must read book for people who embrace changes and are ready to change their habit. This book has always been in my list to read. A very easy going book with such good examples,James clear was so clear in his thoughts that even a kid can understand that all it requires is slight adjustment in your thoughts to change/start a habit. Just wanted to express my gratitude to the author for this master piece"
Atomic Habits,Placeholder,Great book - compelling read,4,The first 50% of the book is beautifully written. Fair warning - about 25% of the book is just references and glossary - technically reading material is only 75% of the book size. But it is a great read to have in your arsenal. Atomic habits is beautifully written - James clear takes a structured and logical way to explain habits and designing them to serve us. I like his ability to have a conversation with me as a reader and take me on the journey. It has influenced me positively.
Atomic Habits,Harsh Singh,Amazing Book/ Packaging should have been better,4,"This book is a must read for anyone &amp; everyone as it talks about building good habits by taking small steps and the ways in which we can stick to those good habits for the long term (It is very easy to drift towards bad habits even after pursuing some good ones because there are so many distractions or simply because our motivation level drops after a few days of following good habits. After all sticking to good habits requires a lot of effort and self control). This book talks about how build such habits which help you develop into a better person and also make those habits interesting so that we do not lose the motivation to continue with them. The packaging from the seller however was a disappointment. The book came in just a plastic cover with no bubble wrap inside to protect the book in transit. As a result, the corners of the book cover were damaged."
Atomic Habits,Amazon Customer,Simple and helpful!,4,"While most of the content is something we already know of in our daily lives, there were many interesting tips to develop and stick to great habits. My biggest take away here is that focussing on systems and habits to improve by 1% daily will automatically make you reach your goals. Audacious goals without great habits are bound not to be reached. Develop great habits on a daily basis and you're on the path to a great life!"
Atomic Habits,Aniruddha Bhattacharya,"The packaging could be better, haven't read the book yet.",4,"Read the review of the book and it was so good so I'm pretty much sure that the book would be great. That I'll check. But as a bookworm I like my book in a super condition, I don't tolerate any flexion on my book. The packaging was so bad, just a paper wrap, should be atleast a box. One corner of the book is damaged, that's literally annoying for me. Maybe it's small but I am really irritated by this. Many readers will understand what I'm talking about, it's about satisfaction and sensitivity."
Atomic Habits,GK,Must read for everyone,4,Useful for everyone who really want to change their life and become successful by removing procrastination and laziness and becoming consistent and productive
Atomic Habits,JP,"Originally received a subpar quality product. However, the replacement copy is of good quality.",4,"The media could not be loaded. The page quality is too thin to be an original. The book looked like it was used, prior to being delivered. New books have tight binding but this one has looser binding so it was either used before or poorly made. I have ordered a replacement. Amazon should have stricter quality control standards with sellers and not allow them to sell subpar quality products. This quality of this book is like the books that are sold by second hand sellers. Buy this book from a bookstore instead of Amazon. UPDATE : I have received the replacement. This time they sent a new, good quality book. The pages in this replacement copy are regular good quality pages that one might find in a book bought from the bookstore and the binding is tight as well. Due to this prompt action, I am increasing the rating from 1 star to 4 stars. I don't have any doubts regarding the quality of content of this book as it was a highly recommended read. I have read the first 20 pages and the content has proven to be interesting so far. (The picture and video attached, is that of the new, replacement copy)"
Atomic Habits,JAYABRATA DAS,A great book on human behaviour,4,"There are some books which are feel good books, and there are books which practical books. Atomic habit is one such insanely practical book which can be applied in life the moment you started reading this book. I remember a similar book I read a few years back 'The Power of Habit' by Charles Duhigg. I would say this book is a easier version than the power of habit book. Concepts are moreover similar in both the books. This book is just written in way so that it's easy to apply the learnings from the book of n daily life. The four key things for forming habits cue, craving, response, reward are discussed in detail in separate chapters. If you are looking for a great book on habit formation read this one first and then you can read 'The Power of Habit' book. Only thing I felt extra and not required is the last one or two chapters. The book could have been shorter. The reason I didn't rate it five star is because already another excellent book has been written on the similar topic by Charles Duhigg"

Atomic Habits,Anurag,Packed with the Power of an Atom,4,This is a self development book that helps one take charge of those little things that lead to big success
Atomic Habits,Priyanka,Logical facts about how to get on to good habits!,4,"It is a must read if you are even a little bit motivated to work on yourself. The book gives you that little trigger you need, that little push to start a great journey. If you want to achieve something in life but you are clueless about where to start, then this is the book for you. It is not about general quotes that tell you to do hard work. Rather, the author gives logical and rational methods for you to move ahead in your life. Four stars because towards the end of it, I started to get distracted and bored and didnt really read thoroughly. Maybe because I was successful in getting my habits on track and my purpose was fulfilled. Anyway, I would totally recommend it!"
Atomic Habits,Swarnava Mazumder,Atomic Habits are for Quitters,4,Atomic Habits gives you the scenery of perceiving what is good and what is bad. It's such a great book that in the end of any chapter the summary is also written in short that almost covers the full chapter . It also shows you diagram based facts of compounding your small habits in your life. Overall very satisfied but when I got the book the book cover was folded and torn.

Atomic Habits,Venkat,"It deserves 5 stars, only after I make the best use of the book",4,"James did a terrific job of knowledge synthesis in this book and Manson's approval of it as 'a supremely practical and useful book' is not an overstatement. The author has ended my lifelong search of how to make habits stick, with his masterful display of four magic laws, and I am finding the book a nugget of wisdom. To me the book's premise (not necessarily the author's statement) is simple: If you want to get to your goal, change your systems, which are nothing but our habits. In other words your goals are defined by your tiny habits, and by corollary, your habits create your goals. By doing exercise daily you create a healthy you, but by smoking daily you create the goal of getting terminal illness. Habits are the foundation of the self. Mr. Clear, you've transformed me, down to the atomic scale, for good."

Atomic Habits,Amazon Customer,Doable tricks can lead to good habits.,3,"ATOMIC HABITS Its too early to tell if its an effective book; but it sure is an inspiring one. Its appeal lies in making good habits seem so easily attainable. It highlights the power of tiny changes; of getting 1% better every day. Like, its better to exercise for two minutes than to not exercise at all. Its better to read just one page than to not read at all. Or for bad habits, try smoking one cigarette less even if you cant quit smoking altogether. It illustrates how a single and simple change can turn into a good habit; like by changing your environment to reduce friction towards the desired habit - place a bowl of fruits on your study table than storing it out of sight. Or signing up at a gym close to your place than one off route. It encourages locking your decisions before you give in to temptation. A lot of these tricks seem obvious and known; but entirely doable! The author, James Clear draws from the Japanese philosophy of Kaizen: micro changes, from Physics: the path of least resistance, from Biology: the response of our brains to instant gratification, etc. The drawback of the book, I felt, lies in that it lays a better roadmap for building good habits than for kicking bad ones. That said, after reading the book, I have begun going for a walk; remains to see how long I continue :)"
Atomic Habits,Cooldude,Good book,3,The paper quality was bad hope it can be improved

Atomic Habits,Placeholder,Good for people who are beginning to develop life discipline,3,This might not be very helpful for those who already have some sort of disciplined mechanism in their lives. Has a great collection of anecdotes and laws / paradoxes. Will be quoting these in my head / social circle.
Atomic Habits,akanksha singh,Quality of the paper,3,"If you are taking 400 rupees for a book, at least make them look readable, the quality of the paper is just not worth of the price In such price, Amazon should seen good quality paper, printing and binding Not satisfied"

Atomic Habits,Arkaprava Dey,Price fluctuation of the book is just unacceptable.,3,I bought this book for rs. 540. After that the seller just dropped the price to below 400. This just not acceptable. Now I can't even return the book at this point. Apart from the price point of view this book is exceptionally good who wants to build new habit &amp; break the bad one. If you get this book under 400 go for it. Or wait for the price to drop.

Atomic Habits,Dipanshu,"Book is amazing, But delivered in very poor condition",3,"The content is just amazing, no doubt about that. But paper quality feels very cheap. Feels like recycled paper is used for printing. When someone pays 550 for something, obviously one would expect good service but Amazon fails in providing this basic service to its customers. It's only the book itself that deserves 5 stars. But the customer experience and the quality of book was very disappointing. I never expected this from Amazon."

Atomic Habits,Anisha Agarwal,Decent and information packed,3,The book is good but I could not help myself but compare it to a very similar book and I found the power of habit much more intriguing to read. However this book was far more detailed and had certainly more to learn. I also found a book contradicting what it said sometimes which was kind of a bummer.
Atomic Habits,Akansha Sharma,Good read!,3,"The detailing and clarity through simple concepts is amazing! However, the writing could have been a little crisp. Still, a recommended read!"

Atomic Habits,Dark_Knight,Good Read.. But didn't offer too much of new stuff.,3,The book was a good read. Overall had some intresting insights about building good habits and getting rid of the bad ones. Howe ver I felt the book didn't offer too much that was not already known..

Atomic Habits,k,Pages missing..not original copy,3,Pages are missing from the book. It does not look like an original copy of the book.
Atomic Habits,Amazon Customer,More blogpost than a book,3,Decent book. It empowers you to look at things differently temporarily but I dont think itll provide any real time change. From the content itself its more a blog post than a real book. Its a compilation of work from multiple other people. There isnt a shred of any real idea or thought from the author in the book.

Atomic Habits,Anu,A naive and delusional interpretation of a complex phenomenon,1,"I bought the book because it is a bestseller and had great reviews but when I was discussing it with my partner, I was asked a series of interesting questions. If there was ever an easy and proven way to change all bad old habits or add any new good habit, why the best-known minds in Psychology like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung were addicted to smoking, along with best ever physicist Albert Einstein? And if someone has found an easy and proven way to build only good habits and break all bad habits recently then why it is not suggested by all doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists and why the inventor of such a critical thing has not given Nobel price in Physiology or Medicine as it would prevent so much premature death and suffering? How the claim of the author guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible can be possible when the human brain is so complicated, that still we understand only a little about it today? Also, can Albert Einstein or all other minds improve 1% every day for their whole life? I found all questions valid and the idea of the book deceptive. I soon came to know that habits are hardwired in the brain and to remove all old habits forever would mean physically removing all the corresponding neural circuits. What one can do however is to develop a new habit that can counter or control the old habit and it will take time and practice. But again, behaviors can be primed and automatically activated from the internal or external cues and it can get extremely convoluted because of endless other genetic, psychological, biological, neural, social, environmental, computational and rest of the known and unknown natural factors related to the human brain. It is wrong to say that we all can break all bad habits forever and add only good ones and it is even harder to decide what is good and what is bad. Identical twins are not exactly the same even when they have the same genes as it is the gene-environment interaction that shapes us and makes each of us unique. Many can obviously break some old bad habits and many can obviously build new good habits but not all can stop all bad habits and not all can install all good habits. And not all can decide what is good and bad. If that would be the case then the world will become perfect in an instant we all know what is good and bad and we all do it. Also if you are already at a peak, 1% improvement every day will compound to extreme new heights in a few years which is not practical for a brain that is bounded. If you are at the bottom, you can improve 1% every day for a few days but it is not sustainable. Information processing and storage of the nervous system is limited and it just cannot improve 1% every day, for the whole life. It is just not possible. No player always plays his or her best we generally tend to oscillate around the mean. If Einstein improved 1% every day he would have invented endless other new theories. At times we can improve a lot in a few days but not always and not every day. I was suggested book cognitive fitness by my partner earlier but it is was a little bit complicated for me and now I can understand why. The human brain itself is complicated. I am not sure about habits, but the author has sure found an easy way to make money. I may post more on this as I learn more about the behaviors."

Given this is a best seller, it is sad to see millions of people who might not have the ability to question the content or have basic scientific knowledge to get brain washed by such sad content. To know why this book and the ideas presented are erroneous, here are some books written by actual researchers easily available over the net: The biology of belief (Bruce Lipton), The Vital Question (Nick Lane) etc."
Atomic Habits,Bharat,Book Quality is Not Good,1,The media could not be loaded. The book quality is very bad I will never buy a book online from Amazon or any other online company I would like to suggest everyone buy books from Shop
Atomic Habits,Agastya K.,Waste of money,1,It is a 300 something page book about simple concepts which every. Single. Damn. Human knows about. This book feels like a waste of time and money. It has nothing valuable which you can take away and gives no help at all with the problems it claims to help solve. It just touches some BASIC ASS schemes which everyone knows about and revolves around them in a very superficial manner. I hate this book so damn much and have requested a refund. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap.
Atomic Habits,Amazon Customer,Low quality paper print,1,"I had received a low quality paper with poorly printed pages of the book. The papers looks dirty and smell bad. The pages in the book were missing (Eg: check the pic page 20 to page 53, in-between pages missing). After requesting for the replacement, received a new copy. The missing pages problem is resolved, but the quality of paper and printed pages of the book is still bad. Dirty old cheap quality paper and stinks while reading. Amazon needs to look into this matter seriously. I would appreciate if amazon can provide original books with high quality paper and print. If there is no quality check and better replacement, I would prefer not to recommend or purchase books from amazon."

Atomic Habits,Mayank Acharya,The Entire First Chapter is Missing,1,"The media could not be loaded.

Atomic Habits,Poornima Kotak,Recieved In Stained & Old Condition,1,"When I order a book to read, I like the book to be in fresh, crisp condition, and most often, I am not disappointed at all. In this case, I ordered ATOMIC HABITS and I was so so disappointed to find the book in a very bad condition. The book looked like it remained on someone's shelf for a year, catching dust, placed on a stained shelf, and the cover was dog-eared at the bottom. I am just keeping the book because I do not want to waste my time. This experience has definitely left a bad taste!"

Win Friends and Influence People,muhammed nasim pc,good,5,lot of good in ideas
Win Friends and Influence People,Aman Pratap Singh,Just Amazing!!!,5,"Well. Dale Carnegies How to Win Friends and Influence People is amongst those few books one doesnt read for mere entertainment or hobby( though I started reading the book with the intention of pure time-pass). Its amongst those worth-reading books through which one comes across the different aspects of human psychology and reaction. The best part is that the aspects described are so true that one might find almost all of them in oneself. One can truly relate to the examples described in the book. I found it weird because it was published in 1936, still, it fitted so well into todays society. Coming to my experiences, I used to be an absolute introvert; not a person anybody would like conversing with. I havent had any friends with whom I could share things. Then I was posted this book by an institute for whose entrance exam I had applied. Getting through this book, I started making friends in about a few months. Now, I always carry it with me, for this is the reason I feel confident, even when conversing with strangers and make contacts quickly. ( I know its like one of those detergent ads where the clothes remain dull before using and suddenly clothes start looking bright after using it. But it's true.) Interesting is, the book doesnt merely read stories but asks you to practice n implement the 12 chapters it contains, with each it brings into the different aspects of human behavior and his tendencies to deal with a particular situation. I wont increase the length of this answer any much, but through my reading the book, I suggest a few points that would help you get the most out of the book : Try to get into each and every corner of the book. Be it acknowledgment, or suggestions. Try not just skipping things. Try going slowly through the book. One chapter at a time. PRACTICE them as much as possible in real life, or on the people just around. This will help you truly synthesize the idea. (Best way to develop your personality.) Not necessarily but try tho make notes, MARK the important statements black-n-blue. This will help you to revise it later. The most important thing is to have PATIENCE. One cannot change ones behavior in a few days, or weeks, or a month. But you must promise yourself that whatever it takes, you will keep practicing. Hope you enjoy reading this brilliant work by Dale Carnegie.."
Win Friends and Influence People,Placeholder,Awesome! Beautiful book on how to make friends,5,Book is very nice and informative. Must read book for everyone who want to be successful in life. Explained in detail with quoting so many real life examples through which we will get an idea of how to deal with people we come across
Win Friends and Influence People,Sparsh rathore,Best book for communication,5,The book is in very good condition and value for money.the book is perfect for me I guess I will improve my communication skills with this.thanking you amazon for providing me this amazing book.
Win Friends and Influence People,Roel Dsouza,Wonderful book,5,I like this book
Win Friends and Influence People,Ashlesha Jambholkar,A Timeless Gem,5,"Iit's a guidebook for living a more fulfilling and successful life. Whether you're seeking to improve your interpersonal skills, advance your career, or simply become a better friend and communicator, this book offers invaluable lessons that will stay with you long after you've turned the last page. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to unlock the secrets of effective communication and positive relationships. Best quality book."
Win Friends and Influence People,NiteRider,"You Must GET it, READ it and IMPLEMENT it in your Life",5,"################ The Content ################ This book is a classic. I have a very big library of non-fiction books and I consider this one to be in my Top 5 'must-read' books. This is much more than a book on communication. It will help you understand yourself and others. It will improve you in many ways. It will work for both personal and professional relations. And even though it was written decades before, the wisdom contained in it is timeless and it will always apply to all human beings. So if you have never read this before, and you are reading this now, then you must GET it, READ it and IMPLEMENT it in your life. ################ The Book Quality ################ Comparing to the quality of the first copy that I had read from a different publisher many years back, this is way better. I got this for a ridiculous price of Rs.99. If you are getting it for Rs.100 to Rs.200, and you have never read it before, then go for it. There were no torn pages or cover as another reviewer had pointed out which may have been a rare incidence. However, if you have already read this multiple times as me and looking to get a fresh copy to keep on your shelf, then this may not be for you. The pages are a bit yellow. The size is a bit small (about 17.5 cm tall). I have to press a little hard in the center to keep both the sides separate to read on the inside edge of the right page. But again, if you have never read it, then there is no issue. Go for it. You can see the pics for some content details and quality. While the pics may not show it clearly due to lighting, there is no problem with the readability of this book. You can read the text very well and you can clearly see that there are no torn pages or covers. --- (Please mark my review as 'HELPFUL' if it has helped you in any way)"

Win Friends and Influence People,PK,A Must Read!,5,"Tell me one thing - what are the attributes that you notice first in a person? How often do you see a person who is loved by all alike? Rarely, right? No matter how good the person is, there will be something/someone who disagrees with them. Everyone's unique. It's natural to have differences in opinion. BUT what if there's a way to reduce this differences, this gap? This book comes with answer to the questions we have on human nature and relations- be it in social or business environment. Do you face difficulty in dealing with other people? Do you often feel no matter how hard you try, you are unable to get any results? Are you seeking answers? If yes, give this book a shot. The author has used simple language throughout the book. If you are new to non fiction, don't worry, you won't have trouble reading this one. (Yup!I'm a newbie) Things I loved about the book: 1. Division of book - The book is divided into four parts. At the end of each part, a brief summary is given. This helps the reader to revise and recollect the points. 2. Incidents - Throughout the book, the author illustrates examples of how people used various principles and what results it had. This way, a reader can grasp the idea easily. You may come across concepts you already know, you may find answers you've been seeking. You may end up loving, liking or not liking(slim chance) this book. But let's keep an open mind while reading this book. If you have read the book, tell me one thing that you learned/would like to try from this book."
Win Friends and Influence People,Aanchal Dangri,Knowledge for influencer,5,"A book everyone should read for slaying in today's society. This guides how to be seen, heard and followed in our group."

There are some principles in the book that has to be applied in practical life to get the effective results, by simply reading the book will not do. Some of the principle are 1) Don't criticize or condemn people. 2) Give honest and sincere appreciation. 3) Become genuinely interested in other person. 4) Make a habit of smiling. 5) Try to remember person's name you meet because a person's name to that person is the sweetest and most important sound. 6) Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. 7) Try honestly to see the other person's point of view. 8) If you are wrong, admit it and emphatically 9) Don't try to win an argument, try to avoid it, if possible let the other person win, you will not be at loss. 10) Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person then other person will cover up and see your mistake smaller. 11) Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers. This principles are very simple but difficulty arise when it comes to apply, so this books provided some beautiful real life examples through which many people had already overcome various hurdles, obstacles using these prinicples. Author had studied about these principles well and certainly it will applicable for everyone including you. This book will help you to improve interpersonal skills, both in professional world and personal life - family, friend and relatives. You will never be at loss by buying this book."
Win Friends and Influence People,Rajat,Want to gain friends,5,"BOOK REVIEW: HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE - Dale Carnegie. This is the book I was waiting so long to get my hands on and finally I'm here with its review. The first thing first: If you really want to get more friends in your life and want other people to do your job, then this book has lots of amazing things for you. This book has lots of techniques which literally help you to influence people in your daily life, business life and personal life as well. Some of the wonderful techniques I should share with you guys;- Desire to Important: We all love to get appreciation and we want to be important in someone's life. Have we ever thought the other may also want the same ? Genuinely Interested in Others: If we want other people to get interested in ourselves, then we have to make ourselves interested in others first. Talk in terms of other person's interest: Yes, that's one of my favourite and I won't want to tell you this. For this you have to go and read this book itself. I would highly recommend this piece of art. Yes, As I said earlier, If you really really want to achieve something and want to make a different spot in the rush then you must read this out and not only just read, start acting upon them."
Win Friends and Influence People,Gokul Nadh,No Words to define,5,"I have addee this book in my bucket list almost 3 years back. Yesterday I finished reading this amazing gift from Dale Carnegie. I was in search of a word so that it can describe this book at its best.later I realised its simply hars to define this book with a single word...thats why I decided to write a review. One of the most difficult things we the people face in our life is How to deal witg other people. From my personal experience as a banker, I would say managing people is one of the most complicated amd critical things in this world. I believe its because we literally fail in understanding the other person completely or we fail to think from other persons perspective. This book is a Bible for personal development and let you think and realise there different perspectives towards a problem or a situation in life. I would like to share one more thing : if u feel that you want to read this book..please order it now without a second thought and read it at the earliest....else please dont buy it..because even at tye age od 25 I realised that its too late to read this book..we should have read this atleast in our school days so that we could act as a better human being...and now i question myself ' Why did i wait for 3 years to read this and realise how things are' So if u want to avoid this question to urself...........you have the answer.. :)"

The reason I am saying this is because the book is an absolute gem and if the lessons are taken seriously, it can change your relationships with people upside down (of course for good ) . Now why should we read it ? 1. Because the world has become more connected then ever before and the only way one can have a great positive influence on others is by being a great communicator , and the book is like a bible on this topic ! 2. It's not rocket science to understand that you need to be a great influencer and communicator to be successful in your life, irrespective of your field.

Win Friends and Influence People,ZUBAIR KHAN,"Amazing book, Nicely Written.",5,"I am glad I choose this book as my first book, If you are introvert or someone who thinks who always face hard time in making friends this book in specially for you. Habits are challenging to develop in our mind, because we already have something inside our head, So i would suggest you to apply one rule at a time and work on it, Its not like you will read and instantly turned into a charming and attractive person. For Ex: In a chapter Dale tell us not to criticize anyone, This new habit is hard to get in our life because by criticizing one will get a sense of pride or feeling that we are better thn the other person, So focus only on this habit to change, And while in process to change criticizing habit, You also need some other habit to replace our criticizing habit, So replace it with positive thing you see in that person. This is just a glimpse what you can get from this book, Best of luck in reading .. :)"
Win Friends and Influence People,Biplaw Kumar SIngh,You can improve human relationships after reading this!!!,5,"Whoa man!!! What a book!!! I, myself being an introvert, wanted to change myself after getting into college. And guess what, I got this book!!! You live with this book. You read it, you practice it, you see yourself improving at handling human relationships. And yes, this book is for everyone, not just for introverts, not just for people working in the corporate sector, not just businessmen. Written by Dale Carnegie, this is a hassle-free read and a 'to the point' type masterpiece. Text is simple, so if you're a non-reader or have average knowledge of English, not a problem at all my dear! This one is for you! It's divided into sections, which in turn is divided into chapters. Each chapter focuses on a particular problem followed by a mind-blowing yet so simple solution. Basically, in each chapter, one of the various tools of handling(and understanding) people is pointed out and then elaborated with the help of a lot of examples of different people from different walks of life(Theodore Roosevelt, business tycoons and much more). This is done to prove the theories of each chapter correct, implying they are tried and tested. Just go for it without any second thoughts and you will find yourself as a better human being after your reading journey. That's a guarantee. Thank You and Enjoy Reading!!!!!"

Would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, as I was going through this book, at certain point I felt that the points suggested are so important that material like this should be taught when growing up so that you have a better understanding of human behaviour right from the start. Lastly I'm going to keep this book handy as it'll be a quick sneak peek type situation when I need a little understanding of human behaviour."

It teaches you the strategies how to deal with people and how to become a likeable person. I think it is very essential think for career. Yet I am not going to summarize it because the aroma comes when you read the whole book. It is not a novel that you read the summery and get influenced by. I love to read hardcover books.

Win Friends and Influence People,Asim Borah,One of the most influential books of the century,5,"Discovering the fact that this text is over 90 years old might push you not to read any further. I urge you NOT to develop this perception that the book doesn't apply to contemporary circumstances. It applies to every generation in the past 500 years. Dale enabled me to perform an in-depth self evaluation. I was able to not only highlight the shortcomings but to rectify them as well. I'd suggest particularly all the introverts out there regardless of wherever you belong to read this book and follow the guidelines. One drawback, I believe, was the inability to distinguish flattery from 'honest appreciation' in cases where an individual is not worthy of praise. Another ordinary factor associated to this book is its title. This provides another instance of 'don't judge a book by its cover' hypothesis."

Who wants to become manipulative and bossy??? But the book is anything but that! It is a very practical book on dealing with people with empathy. Very very applicable in everyday life. I've recommended it to so many people, but they all stop at the title. Please note, this book was published many decades ago and such titles made sense that time. It is a wonderful book if you can get past the title. There is a note in the beginning saying that some of the examples from the original edition have been changed to suit today's times. That is fair. It doesn't look misplaced. (I bought a kindle version of this book which was on sale for about Rs.35)"

Win Friends and Influence People,Abhishek Gupta,A must read book...,4,"Well Starting my review about this book I would like to mention this book is for those who want to clarify what they want in their life and get it with guided path, so, if you are a guy like that do read this review to get what this book offer! I purchased this book when my neighbor son referred this book to me who is currently working on google. I purchased this book and started this book when it arrived. Shockingly, I completed this book within 16 hours as I can read novels non-stop though I wasn't able to grasp everything from this book. So, I after few days I read this book again and shockingly I got to understand few pages that were going out of my mind but still it was not satisfying on the second read as a lot of points weren't getting in mind maybe I had slow understanding because of very complex language but when I took this book for 6th time then I got to understand what they were trying to explain in detail. Seriously, to understand the book you need to have at least 3 to 4 sitting with this book as the author even himself required to read this book to get the wordings back into mind to publish a new edition. But if you read this book thoroughly then you will be able to anything in your life with full joy with greater chances of success. But If you found our review helpful Kindly mark this review helpful as it would encourage us to post more reviews and guide you to get the right products and deals as fast as possible!"

Win Friends and Influence People,Shakti Chauhan,Its a Classic - A lot of it is Gold - Some of it seems too Vanilla and not realistic.,4,"First half of the book is especially good - very tightly packed with a lot of Value. Second half becomes a little repetitive. Also, some stories seem too skewed to make the point and not real. In reality there are always two sides to any point and the other side was not explored at all. For Example - A guy like Steve Jobs broke every rule in this book and still was a very effective leader. In any case, a lot of value in the book. Worth reading for sure."

Win Friends and Influence People,Aadya,Content is redundant but still a must read.,4,"The book is wow at first! It amazes of how much I lack the tactics and the self-control needed while having heated discussions. It's full of real life examples, which helps, because I wouldn't want to be simply lectured on how I should 'behave'. But half way across the book, the examples run out of establishing newer, better points. They become redundant, so after a point I stopped feeling amused, I already knew what the examples may contain. Why I recommend: No matter what, it's a must read. It definitely points out what we are missing as individuals. Although the examples provided won't work in every situation, but they are the option to ponder on the next time I'd want to keep my arguments on the table. Alternative: Getting hands on its ebook would be good as the content isn't too much to not be able to finish easily."
Win Friends and Influence People,Pankaj,Read this book if you want to change your experience to dealing with people or friends.,4,"It's just amazing and one of my favorite.

It's clean, white with no pages missing or no wear and tear of any kind. Regarding the information contained in the book, I still need to start reading it so that is something for another day. Otherwise, an extremely good deal on something I always wanted to buy."
Win Friends and Influence People,Anmol Sarma,The original 'self-help' book,4,"The original self-help book. Carnegie offers solid advice for dealing with business relationships and public speaking. While some of it may be obvious, its especially useful for introverts and people with social anxiety because it outlines a few simple techniques that make meeting new people a little easier. However, some of the techniques for conflict resolution come across as outright manipulative. I doubt it will be life-changing but if youre going to read a self-help book, you could certainly do a lot worse than How to Win Friends. Would recommend."

Win Friends and Influence People,S Kumar,An interesting read...and that's it,3,"This book is an interesting read and one can learn useful skills on how to make friends. However, I felt I dont need to make friends with everybody and all kind of people. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time. The advice given in the book is valuable to the sales person who need to please all type of people. It may also be good for people who have personality issues and finds it difficult to make friends. I would like to make friends by being myself and risking rejection. I would like to influence people in honest way without any manipulation and pretending. Having said that, the book is an interesting read and not all garbage."
Win Friends and Influence People,DIBYA SWARUP,Afraid if it is a genuine copy of the book,3,The content of the book is awesome and it can really enlighten someone but the authenticity of the publication house or the seller is under doubt. 8 pages are missing (209-216). This is disappointing.
Win Friends and Influence People,Being Customer,Nothing new,3,"If you have been a good average person then it's highly likely that you already know these principles by now. If you still want to read the book, you can rather read the things listed at the end of every chapter/part in nutshell. Most of the points are self explanatory. However some of the stories are interesting if you like reading stories, and which sort of explains the same points, but there are too many stories proving single point."
Win Friends and Influence People,prateek sood,Not good quality print,3,Received this book through post not amazon. The quality is not good but according to price its ok.
Win Friends and Influence People,Amazon Customer,Good Read.,3,"The book is the best seller for decades and there are some beautiful tips. Taking away two stars cause in my opinion from several chapters author suggests the reader to be more diplomatic in his communication. Being diplomatic pinches me. And I truly appreciate and approve the authors idea to be more empathetic, courteous and respectful with people. And the subjects he refers to in his study are also apex diplomats or businessmen. So its certainly not a ultimate principle but a great well researched beginners guide."
Win Friends and Influence People,Shrikant Auti,Nice,3,"I wish I had read and understood this book at least a decade ago. Things would have been far far different for me. Nonetheless, better late than never. Shall practice what Mr. Carnegie has advised us through the book. This book will surely make in a good business, but also a good human being as most of the Principles herein are so generous and selfless in nature that at times it will be difficult to practice, but that's where we need grit. Thank you, Dale!"

Win Friends and Influence People,Atul,3 star- An honest review,3,"It is a nice but being written in 1937 for the first time, it's not as much as applicable as it could been 10 years before. People after 2010, I believe, have become more sarcastic and cannot be easily moulded with the ideas given in this book."

Win Friends and Influence People,Ravikumar Paulpandian,3 stars,3,Starts off well but gets redundant as the book progresses..The barrage of anecdotes might have sounded well with an audience but not so in the book. Most of what has been said in the book has become common knowledge long ago.Nevertheless a good read to pause and see where we are at handling people.
Win Friends and Influence People,Amazon Customer,You can avoide purchase,3,"Whatever this book trys to explain is very general and you dont really need to read such a fat book to know that, I would suggest that you rest the summary online you you will receive the same knowledge without wasting lot of time.

Win Friends and Influence People,Sahil Bihari,A very average book,3,"Could have been written in a more interesting manner. Although the examples given by the author are relevant to what he's trying to convey, they seem to be very uninspiring. Also, I found nothing extraordinary to take away from this book. 90% of the things to do mentioned by the author are usually already done by everyone who has common sense. Superb handling and timely delivery by amazon as usual."

Win Friends and Influence People,Alan jason,"very informative book , poor paper quality .",2,"The quality of the book cover is really not good so is the paper quality once if damaged the 'mark stays forever' . if u intend to make markings in the book for future referencs ,this quality book is not very good for such intentions because the paper is so thin and fragile that if i use a highlighter 2 mark lines that i like i can see the markings on the next page. What matters most is the information in the book which is very valuable the information probably not even taught in schools. If you really want to learn more about how people think and if u really want to improve your own understanding this book is highly recommended so far i am on the last chapter of the book . Will sure write another review in regards the contents of the book. Currently the price of the book has fallen down and it's worth purchasing the book at rs100 or less than that ."
Win Friends and Influence People,Ashay Pathare,Quality,2,"The quality of product is poor. Pages were not sticked to its hardcover, I have to stick it after receiving the book."
Win Friends and Influence People,Rohan,"Slightly outdated, riddled with out of the blue illustrations",2,"Read this book if you satisfy any of following conditions 1. You want to know about the atiquetes of living in 1940s-60s. You are well aware of the historical figures from late 1800s and early 1900s such as Lincon, Rockerfeller etc. 2. You dont care if the illustrations/examples the author would use to prove his point do not have any firm factual footing. eg. the author often gives an example of a person he met or a relative he talked with. Historical examples such as Lincon, Rockerfeller are fine but personal anectots of the author may put you off. List of principles at the end of chapters is pretty good. In the preface, author says that we may want to read and reread the book several times, but I would say just skim through the book once thats well enough."
Win Friends and Influence People,Nisha,Felt it was more of an advertisement than a self help book,2,"Though this book does have a lot of good points, I feel it is like a religious and an advertisement book than a self help book 1. The book gives you a huge list of dos and donts. a collection of anecdotes of USA's best men but it does not help me to take in things step ny step and does not help me to change myself. It touches on everythign that needs to be changed about oneslf but does not help one really practice it. And I, being an Indian, found it tough to understand many of political points of USA that were mentioned, which was a little annoying. 2. Dale Carnegie advertises his talks and self help classes saying 'I did this , i did that', which was quite unpleasant and bostful to read. On the whole, I guess these are points which many of my language classics like 'Thirukkural' have laid down almost 2000 years ago, and the book, according to me, was a waste of time."

Win Friends and Influence People,Saurabh Agarwal,The content of this book is outdated!,2,"The contents of this book are outdated. The writer needs to come out with a revised updated version. This book was written in 1936 and all the stories and examples given in this book are of that era in America. A self-help book needs to be universally relatable, which this one is not. Only some one with an acute interest in American history will find this book enjoyable. I lost interest half way."
Win Friends and Influence People,Shaw,Hard to get!!! Don't go for it.,2,"Never buy, if you are interested in more practical examples than historical happenings. This book could be suitable for America natives. I just read 1st chapter of the book and got literally bored, as for examples go around American history, culture and all the real life incident are such described that it won't help unless read several times, forcefully. Also If your native language is not English, it might be difficult to understand too. Initiated the return. Indians, don't go for it."

Win Friends and Influence People,Dineshboss,Honest review about how this 84 year old book did against the test of time.,2,"This book is all about 'what you should do' and not 'how to do it'. When it comes to the how part it sort of says figure it out. Also it teaches you to not voice your opinion and always be a people pleaser which might work in 1936 but as we know doesn't work in 2020 anymore as people are sceptical towards excessive kindness and generosity. Unless you feel otherwise, I do not recommend thsi book."

Win Friends and Influence People,Kaushik Sharma,Outdated and Basic !!,2,"The concepts are preety basic and some of them even outdated. The book explains simple concepts with way too many examples and some examples of how that technique worked magic seems to good to be true or may be it worked back then.

Win Friends and Influence People,Chandan nayak,Not a original product,2,It is not a original product I'm so upset for that
Win Friends and Influence People,Sai Thiru,"Worst, irresponsible package.",1,"The content is not the focus of this review. As you can see from the enclosed images, this is about the packaging. The seller is completely careless and ignorant of the significance of this excellent book. I ordered it for my kids even though I read it as a child and have continued to do so ever since. It remains great even in this day and age. Seller, you ought to feel ashamed of yourself."

Win Friends and Influence People,Rahul,Fake copy of an original book,1,"I've brought this book thinking I'm getting it for very cheap and that too hardcover but it turns out this is not the original book but a fake copy of it with hardcover strapped on it. You can understand just by touching the pages , absolutely low quality and this is what most people forget to mention in these reviews . The book is great due to it's content but very bad in terms of physical quality of it. Make sure to check seller ratings before you buy anything from Amazon and try to buy from Cocoblu as much as possible Hope it helps."
Win Friends and Influence People,Ms Khan,Don't purchase this... You will regret,1,I would recommend you don't purchase this book from this seller the chapters are not in the proper manner arrange they are shuffled here and there like the chapter 4 is on the first page the chapter 2 is on the last page so its not good and some parts are even deleted
Win Friends and Influence People,akshay malhotra,One Star print quality,1,"Well, as opposed to many and many people. I am rating this book a lowly one star!!! Please don't get me wrong. The book is amazing and I am enjoying reading this book to my heart's content. The star rating is based only on the printing quality of the book. When you go buy a classical book like this, You have some expectations regarding the quality of the book. And I am sorry to say that this particular publisher has failed miserably on that. The print quality, the paper used, the margins kept are all of abysmal quality. It is the 'cheap' reprint version of the original classical. Your can get a similar quality paper from a roadside vendor who sells the take copies of the novels. You can actually go for a online PDF version of the book than buying this book. During the start of the book, the author talks about the empty pages in the book to take notes. And forget the empty pages, the publisher havn't even kept enough margin in the book. The books like these needs extra pages to scribble your notes."
Win Friends and Influence People,Placeholder,This book could have been completed in a few pages,1,"Stories. And painfully boring stories. Told to give simple one-liner self-help messages, which written at the back of every chapter as 'Principles'. One of them was 'smile'. Yeah, believe it or not. Save your money. Don't buy this. Instead, google 'HTWFAIP summary' or borrow it from a friend and read those one liner principles. P.S.: there's nothing i this book that you didn't know earlier."
Win Friends and Influence People,NB,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,1,"I will be brutally honest. As I read the book, it felt too booring and meaningless. The book is full of examples from lives of unknown personalities which the reader can not correlate. The book itself was published in 1936 and majority of principles are obsolete and impractical. As if the author was living in a womderland when writing the book. Do not fall into the ratings trap as the book is not worth and so are other titles by the author as they were written decades ago."
Win Friends and Influence People,Shiza Thayatt,Worst copy of a best book,1,"The publisher doesn't shown respect to such a great book, it is very disappointing to see such great book in worst paper anyone can print.. Anyway the cover looks as original!!!"
Win Friends and Influence People,SHARAN MR,content of the book is good but physical book is poor quality.,1,"My book pages are loosely stitched to the book cover, very easily it will fall off, very poor quality of gum has been used, for this same reason I bought the hardcover book hoping it will be better than a paperback, Guess I was wrong."

Win Friends and Influence People,Sagnik,Insufficient!,1,Either an ego soother or provoker. Not devoid of the materialistic fortune seeking attitude of outdated self help writers. Provides excessive examples utilizing eminent personalities over analytical representation. Concerned about success over purpose of living- which is itself enough to win friends and influence people. The proper title should have been 'How to gain attention and persuade others to serve your purpose'. Only a few words of wisdom could be extracted out of 300 pages( by me).

The Alchemist,Vallabha Sayar,Words that are capable of slowing down your heartbeat,5,"I received a very high quality product. The cover and hard bind were intact and it looks very fat for a 230 odd page book so the quality of pages is impeccable. It's also a very cute and adorable size, given I have tiny hands. Now the content: The original book has been translated into English and though it doesn't seem like a natural translation, the words do strike the right chords in one's heart. It speaks of philosophical principles such as the universe conspiring to get you what you strongly desire and about understanding the language of the world, which is love. At the surface they might seem well, superficial but everything around us is continuously emitting its own energy and when you're able to read it's wavelength, you really 'understand' phenomenon around you. The author calls these as omens. Like the camels and the men of desert that speak the language of the desert. It's really a simple and beautiful concept. A nomad in the desert has been observing the desert for eternities and can make predictions about the whereabouts of water the weather at night, etc. In the same way a sailor who sees endless stretches of water every day knows things about the tides, the sun, the rains, the winds and the clouds. This is what the author means by 'communicating with the sun, the clouds, the wind'. The other is about the universal language: love which is also a beautiful concept where two individuals in love seem to 'vibe' and just get each other. When you're oscillating at similar wavelengths you're more likely to absorb each other's energies. So, long story short, this is a beautiful read that'll put your mind at ease with every page you flip. It's also a book about hope and finding the real treasure. Real treasure is not a lot of gold like the protagonist sets out to search for but your own spiritual self that needs nurturing. And once you get there, you are the Alchemist, everything you touch turns into gold."
The Alchemist,Kindle Customer,Shows how to pursue meaningful life,5,The book presents the vagaries that a boy encounters while pursuing his Personal Legend. It also guides us to realize our dreams.

The Alchemist,Amazon Customer,"The Alchemist, is an inspiration for everyone for seeking their path in life and realizing their destiny'",5," IT IS AN INSPIRATION FOR EVERYONE FOR SEEKING THEIR PATH IN LIFE AND REALIZING THEIR DESTINY, AS WELL AS THE ESSENTIAL WISDOM OF LISTENING TO OUR HEARTS' BY- Bhaskar jyoti Deka, 27 Dec,2016 B.A 1st semester, Darrang college, Tezpur According to The Alchemist, Personal Legends serve as the only means by which an individual can live a satisfying life. In fact, the universe can only achieve perfection if all natural things continuously undergo a cycle of achieving their Personal Legend, evolving into a higher being with a new Personal Legend, and then pursuing that new goal. This concept, that the individualistic pursuit of a Personal Legend exists as lifes dominantperhaps onlyspiritual demand, lies at the center of the unique theology of The Alchemist. As we see when Santiago must give up his flock and leave Fatima, material success and even love pose obstacles to Santiago achieving his Personal Legend and must be delayed or ignored altogether. Those who put off their Personal Legends, such as the crystal merchant, suffer regret and fail to experience the wealth and other favors that the universe bestows upon those who follow their Personal Legends. In the novel, even alchemy, the central symbol of the book, entails coaxing metal to achieve its own Personal Legend to turn into gold. As a result, the idea that all individuals should live in the singular pursuit of their individual dreams emerges as the primary theme of The Alchemist. In The Alchemist, the spiritual unity represented by the Soul of the World binds together all of nature, from human beings to desert sand. This idea underlies the parallel we see in the novel between the alchemist purifying metal into gold and Santiago purifying himself into someone capable of achieving his Personal Legend. According to the novel, the Soul of the World has created an ultimate desire, or Personal Legend, for everything, whether Santiago or a piece of iron. To accomplish its Personal Legend, each thing must learn to tap into the Soul of the World, which purifies it. That continual purification ultimately leads to perfection. This notion of humans, metals, and all other things sharing the same goal demonstrates that all elements in nature are essentially different forms of a single spirit. Furthermore, over and over again we see that Santiago must communicate with nature in what the novel calls the common language of the world. Santiagos horse, for instance, communicates with him by showing him evidence of life in an apparently barren expanse of desert, and Santiago must employ the help of the desert, the wind, and the sun in order to turn into the wind. As the alchemist says when he leaves Santiago, everything from a grain of sand to God himself shares the same spiritual essence. This pantheistic view dominates The Alchemist, and along with the individual, evolutionary theology expressed in the theme of alchemy, it forms the books core spiritual message. THEME OF THE BOOK The book's main theme is about finding one's destiny. According to me The Alchemist is 'more self-help than literature.' An old king tells Santiago, 'when you really want something to happen, the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true.' This is the core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays all throughout Coelho's writing in The Alchemist."
The Alchemist,Thabresh Syed,Finding ones destiny or purpose in life :),5,"The Alchemist is a fantastic book and the storytelling is beautiful.The choice of words are impeccable, full of wisdom and philosophy .I totally loved it .The story is very enchanting and bursts with optimism which I think is very important in our lives .The book shows that the journey to your destiny is as important as the destiny itself.I love how the book emphasizes on the importance of faith,hope and spirituality through the story of an ordinary boy.I think this book appeals to everyone because we all have dreams and sometimes we just want someone to tell us that they may come true.Overall,The Alchemistis a very exciting fiction novel and it deserves a space at everyones bookshelf. Favorite quotes from the book Ones Personal Legend(destiny) is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, its because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. Its your mission on earth.Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a seconds encounter with God and with eternity.Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist If someone isnt what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist Love is not to be found in someone else but in ourselves; we simply awaken it. But in order to do that, we need the other person.Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving. Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist You can become blind by seeing each day as a similar one. Each day is a different one, each day brings a miracle of its own. Its just a matter of paying attention to this miracle. Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist Its the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist."
The Alchemist,Sanjana Murali,Lost and found on Mars!,5,"Not everyone dares to follow their dream, even if they do they will have to come across a lot of struggles and failures that blocks their road to their dreams. Paul has given an inspiring wisdom in the form of a simple recipe to all the human beings who have that passion and drive to follow their dreams but are afraid to take that one step forward. The protagonist, Santiago, a shepherd in Andalusia, is described so vibrant in this book, by which one can liven that character. I lived with the protagonist through out the book. I travelled with Santiago from Andalusia in Spain to Egyptian desert in search of a treasure that was dreamed to be buried in the pyramids. We met gypsy women, one who can interpret the dreams than any other. By the wishes from the man who calls himself a king, we decided to cross the sands of the deserts, I even felt the move and shake of the camel. In the desert, we met an alchemist from whom we learned the language of the soul, philosopher's stone and elixir of life. He pointed us to the direction of the quest. Finally, we reached the Egyptian pyramids together to find the treasure and our personal legend. Those that are dismissed as childhood fantasies like the dreams we have, the nature we speak to, the omens we encounter, the people we meet are all the guidance of our inner voice to find our personal legend. We realized. All the characters portrayed in the book had their own purpose to serve in one way or the other to the main theme of the subject. The two core elements which turned the spotlight on are ' Look within yourself you will find all the answers ' - Listen to your heart and ' Transform your dream into reality '. When the obstacles faced are increased, it means we are just one step beneath from reaching our desired dreams. To achieve the core elements, the protagonist faced a lot of hardship which concludes that an open mind, perseverance and courage can guide us in the right path to success. The other element which is highlighted through out the book is ' When you really want something, the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it'. When you are really in need of a life coach, Paulo can give you one through his astounding book, ' The Alchemist '. This book is a discovery of the treasure within. Rich. Vivid. Boundless. I relate this book with this simple line, ' Lost and found on Mars', because, the treasure is within ourselves, our inner voice is our greatest treasure, we are a great treasure to ourselves. Whatever will happen to you, starts from you. We are our destiny. Be it happiness or melancholy, it is we who create it. We are responsible for our own desires and consequences. Instead of searching the treasure within ourselves, we search it in all the ruined and clueless places. If we look within ourselves patiently, we can find all the treasures in the World. Being a deaf to ourselves is the greatest stumbling block than the truth itself. Now, doesn't the phrase, ' Lost and found in Mars ' makes sense to you? I hope you sense it."

It's a book which inspires you to follow your dreams. This book will give you strength to keep following what you believe in. The book is a story of a shepherd boy who leaves everything he ever had in order to find his tresure, Story deals with an internal conflict between his love and personal dreams but this novel ends up showing love as a supporting tool for achieving his dream."
The Alchemist,Im47GT,Worth it.,5,"The Alchemist takes you to a journey of a young Shepherd. Of How he discovered his treasure and how the whole world conspired to make him reach his fate, for what he was destined. I'm giving it a 5/5."
The Alchemist,Kshitiz Dadhich,A must read book,5,Wonderful storyline and an awesome concept. The story keeps you gripped throughout. The book motivates you to listen to your heart and follow what your gut feeling and istincts. Initially there would be challenges but at the end you will surely get what you desire for and what you deserve!
The Alchemist,kiran badiger,"A book for ages, must try",5,"After reading this book you will start feeling like everything in universe is talking with you, trying to communicate with you, while I am writing this review I feel like this phone in my hand is trying to communicate with me, must try this book it will make you feel better in whatever situation you are in"
The Alchemist,Ashish Prasad .com,A Story Everybody Can Relate To.,5,"It's not everyday you find an author who's fiction has sold more than 65 million copies world wide and of course one doesn't need to review when the work speaks for itself. But as an English speaker, I could easily see why the author's writing is so disorganised or incoherent - main reason could be that it's been translated from Portuguese. The characters and the story jumps from one setting to another without introducing them prior. It perhaps would have been more annoying to read if this book had more pages added into it. But that being said, obviously, you can't expect much with the coherence of writing a novel when it has been translated from a foreign language. Getting down to the story itself - The story is about the journey of an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago and his escapades which will involve life's ups and downs along with the priceless rewards life offers for one who stands till the end. Santiago, believing a recurring dream to be of higher purpose, decides to travel to a nearby town to discover its meaning. A gypsy woman tells him that there is treasure in the Pyramids in Egypt. So he starts his adventure which will change his life forever. I've to be honest, it seemed a bit too religious for my liking when I started and I did find myself getting a wee bit bored in the first couple of chapters. But I don't remember at what point, I was hooked on to the book and I finished it in one sitting. Soon after I finished the book, I felt a silence and a sense of awe in me. I consider good writing to be something that offers a positive change and evokes positive emotions. This book did just that bringing back the best of positive emotions- love and hope. In a way, I could say The Alchemist re-ignited my rusty-dreams back into action. There is a lot to learn from the story and it is going to take a bit to process it. I would say you'll need to take the reading lightly - Just read it till the end with an open mind and let the story sink into your subconscious. Whether you like it or not, be assured for a positive change - it will come to you, just keep your mind open. We all take hits in life and we need those things that will trigger all the positive emotions to come back stronger and more alive. The Alchemist is one of those life-altering things."
The Alchemist,Surja,Must read,5,This is a classic. Should read once if you have deeper questions about life and a mind which can decipher metaphors

I would like to say one thing about this book like at least everyone should read this book in their life before you die.i would recommended this book from age of 9 years old to adult and even yougesters can read this book."

The Alchemist,Goks,Searching of Dreams - Listen to your Heart ! Its teaches you in a better way.,5,"The Alchemist: I have never tried of reading a contemporary book, but this happens just by a way i was surfing. Yeah, most of the time, you get attracted to the stuff unknowingly. The Alchemist. Searching of Dreams - People won't realise the meaning of the word until they put up their heart to work on it. Dreams, finding your happiness, where your heart goes and reaching the destiny. - Its not just a word, its a life. I found the name Alchemist somewhere and went to google it. There i found the reason,the urge of my heart to search. Soul of Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist is something where all your thought merge together to get the reason of your life. A Play of Dream and Mind - is like 'Sea - Saw'. When your mind goes down with a word of Acceptance and it just settle down and watch silently. there you find silence but you never find happiness over it. But remember Dream always keeps you fly high. Whenever you fly high, there might be always a pressure to put you down and make you fear of unknown. Just think of it, if you have the capability to achieve something, do it and get it. Flying High and handling the pressure makes you realise 'Dream and reaching the destiny' is not just a simple word. Whenever your mind goes down to earth, your dream reaches higher to higher. Once a man decides to go for his dream, even the whole universe conspires to help him. Fly high with full of Dreams, set your mind to rest for a while to handle pressure,listen to the word of your heart, it will guide you in a better way than any other does. You don't have to wait for a time to make it happen, it just happen in a flow. So there always comes a time even the Sun gives a way to settled down in Star to shine brightly. - So called A Kind' of refreshment what i felt after reading the book, thought to share my experience, Thanks !"
The Alchemist,surendra kumar sharma,OMG,5,Nice
The Alchemist,Vishnu,"when you really want something, the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it'",5,"This work has gone beyond the bounds of literature and developed a life of its own, igniting a global movement. The Alchemist is a book that blends a mediaeval mystic atmosphere with the voice of the desert; Santiago and the reader are followed by dreams, symbols, signs, and adventure like echoes of ages-old wise voices. With this allegoric book, Coelho makes the point that we shouldn't run from our destiny and exhorts readers to pursue their goals because doing so will help them find God, or happiness, fulfillment, and the ultimate goal of creation, which he defines as their 'Personal Myth' and mission on Earth."
The Alchemist,Neha,A yes from me...,5,This story is about a boy who didn't ignore the call of the universe and followed his intuition. It beautifully explains how we can find our true destiny when we believe in ourselves and instead of ignoring chances we accept it. If someone truly wishes for something from his heart then he will definitely get it when he is not afraid of getting out of his comfort zone and facing obstacles in his way of life. And yes book was delivered on time in good condition. Hope this is helpful...

The Alchemist,Mohammad Faizan Khan,Such a magical book that's why strongly recommend to every classic lover (reader) !!,5," Reading the Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept.' I've read all type of books but 'The Alchemist' is so different in every aspects. *Book Review* ~ The Alchemist- By Paulo Coelho. The cover of the book is simple,decent and focusing at the main plot of the story. The book is a light read of approx 160 pages where the author impeccably written the story with very impressive narration, plot and characters. This great book have changed my way of thinking about goals and destiny, completely. 'Every man kills the thing he loves.' ~ The story revolves around a young boy, a shepherd who wants to fulfill his dream to see the great pyramids and find the treasure, that he had seen in his dream. So he went to reach his destiny and in doing so, he met different new souls who helped him to complete his journey to see the pyramids and the treasure. 'Your eyes show the strength of your soul.' ~ He met with a desert girl, Fatima and both fell in love with each other. Later he met with main character of the story, an Alchemist who educated him about the alchemy and helped to achieve his dream. During the journey, the boy learnt many lessons of the desert. The author have so brilliantly written this book with an amazing plots and lessons that i have finished it in less than a day. I strongly recommend this magical piece to every reader who wants to pick their next read (classic). I'm sure after reading this book you will come to know that 'There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.' My ratings- 5/5 "
The Alchemist,Ashfiya Undre,Overjoyed !!!,5,"Book Review : It is my first book that I read of Sir Paulo Coelho, I must say that I am still drooling over it. It is from one of those books which should be read at least once in a lifetime. It will actually change your perspective and your way of living if you are a perciever. You wont be able to categorise this book as per genre because it is part and parcel of everything from self-help, to philosophical fiction to mystery, suspense and what not. The Philosopher`s Stone and The Elixir of Life : These two words have always, will always intrigue me not matter what. And this book served the purpose by clearing my dilemma about the term Alchemist. I am person who would rather choose a Dan Brown or Sci-fi Book or a movie than a Romedy or a Comedy one. Now here comes what is the book about : A young Shepherd boy named Santiago, a passionate traveller who thinks there is more to life than what he actually lives with his flock of sheep and his home Andalucia. One day when he realises that the same dream which he has been having constantly is not a mere coincidence but something more fascinating, he gathers up the courage and set the journey of what would be of life-changing consequences. The surreal encounters, unrealistic sights and life endangering decisions teaches him one of the greatest lessons of life and world which cant be seen with any naked eye and an ideal mind which is ignorant of the core element of the World. I would definitely recommend this to every reader and non-readers too, as can be of great help for those are lost in life or need some spiritual support and for curious Bibliophiles like me. Thank you"
The Alchemist,HARINARAYANAN M,ALCHEMUST''- A MUST READ BOOK For All,5,I had been purchasing this for gifting to people as the most inevitable Book of the legendary Paulo Koehlo so that they remain hopeful for auspicious happenings in life after reading it in depth..
The Alchemist,Abhishek gaurav,Reading it was looking up at sky and journing my destiny by reading the stars,5,"Though book is not a first read book for those who never read. I am saying these beacause i found many insisting the begginers to start from here. Please don't do that beacuse the book simple yet very meaningful in its own way. And those who are not accustomed with authors imaginative world and their way of looking at world will not gonna impresed by the uniqueness of this book. The book is brilliant no need to say this. Read and think on every page , not just read in ego that i had already read muvh fater books than this . So finiahing it in few ours is nothing for me. If you think and do so , you are more fool than you will ever be ."
The Alchemist,Alandal Das,Small but good,5,"Have not started reading but about the quality of the book I am satisfied thick cover and good quality pages. But I was expecting little more bigger book, but its ok because the book cannot be bigger, if they make the book bigger the paper count will be less so it wont look good. ( this is my opinion )"

Lovely read again"
The Alchemist,Vibhuti Chaddha,Life changing,5,It's a Geeta of life
The Alchemist,Pratheesh Raj,A must read book,5,"I love this book so much. Some of the points that I love from this book: 1. If you startout by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work toward getting it. 2. When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it 3. There were certain things one shouldn't ask about, so as not to flee from one's destiny. 4. It's called the principle of favorabilility, beginner's luck. Because life wants you to achieve your destiny. 5. You must always know what it is that you want. 6. Beauty is the great seducer of men. 7. Every blessing ignored becomes a curse. 8.

The Alchemist,Sridhar Munendramani,pleasant treasure,4,Treasure it is. Good to read and had a good message. Feeling positive after having a read. Recommend this and very quick to read
The Alchemist,NEHALKUMAR JOSHI,Philosophical Delight,4,Sorry is gripping and the book can be read full in two or three sittings. However it is full of lessons and miracles as well so one has to use common sense to extract the meaning. There are many events in the book where interpretation of the reader will matter the most.
The Alchemist,Adil Mustaqueem,Perspective changing,4,"Teaches you to listen to your gut, or get back in touch with it if you lost it."

The Alchemist,Manav goyal,Good fiction book to read,4,"The alchemist' firstly this fiction is okay if you want to read something easy and with not many characters. Now I think this book is really a good read if you are new to fiction world in the book segment. This book is really well written. And the story is really good with many good parts in the story. And to open to a new world of fiction. The character of the boy (protagonist) is really well written and this book offers a great perspective of how you view the world. This book is really a great fiction if you are starting out in the world of fiction. Here, now 'Panlo coelho' has written this book in easy language if and the space between the words is good because if you are reading for the first time it might be hard to read if the words are small and the space is less. But with this book that is not going to happen the words are printed in a well readable size and with a good space to make it easy to read. And this book is for all ages and if offers a really good story if you want kids to read it. would definitely recommend to go for this book if you are starting out in the world of fiction and are beginner to book reading."

The Alchemist,Tanmay raj,The pages,4,The media could not be loaded. The book is awesome and cost me 183 only. The pages are enough quality you could read easily.
The Alchemist,Shiv,A fable about following your dream,4,"Everyone has dreamed of something atleast once in their life, some realize their dreams sooner and some later. But at a certain point of life we abandoned those dreams. Reasons?? We were not trying enough? We were doing our best but still no results? The responsibilities and the people that are holding us back. 'When you want something the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it' quite amusing isn't it? But there are times when everything goes wrong 'When the world shoves you around, you just gotta stand up and shove back. It's not like somebody's gonna save you if you start babbling excuses.' Life is sure great if you have the dreams to chase. Loved the book, go follow your dream try as hard as you can and in the end you will have no regrets."
The Alchemist,Rahul Lal,A fable which will motivate you like no other,4,"I had read this book for the first time, almost 5 years ago and absolutely fell in love with it. The realisation of your aims is beautifully portrayed in this book. Regarding the physical overview, the book is nice, the cover is paperback which could be better but at this price I've no complains!"

The Alchemist,Leeshya,Just go for it!,4,"This was my first reads of Paulo Coelho and also the first book that I've started my reading journey. If you are a beginner and finding difficult on getting some easy written books, this is that book. It's so well written with simple words, easy to grasp the concept.

The Alchemist,Hardik,Small but amazing,4,I was searching for a short book cuz reading long one's makes me tired and sucks up all my motivation to read them. This was a perfect one for that reason. The story is subtle and knowledgefull. It never bores us. Overall a great one. Must try!
The Alchemist,Santosh Panda,"good, interesting, inspirational read !!!",4,"This book, The Alchemist is my first read of Paulo Coelho. We all know a lot about Paulo, dont we?? The book is a fable about following your dream. And with that, its also a book which will teach you a way to lead your life. The inspirational/philosophical books are written in a way which usually makes a reader bore. But the book which has an interesting story to read, and which redefines your soul in some manner is always a worthy read. If you go with the story, this book will show you the way to follow your dream. Here, the Author has narrated the story of an Alchemist who was just like any other boy. While following his dream, he met a woman who interpret dreams, a king who inspires him, an Englishman and finally an Alchemist who helps him in realizing his own worth. While reading, I bet, you cant stop turning pages. The 160pages of beautiful writing makes it small and a quick read. And the ending will make you realize what the book is all about. I will go with the Authors word: When you want something, the entire universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."
The Alchemist,Arjun Vaishnav,Okay,4,Nice one but I bought poket edition.
The Alchemist,Kindle Customer,A thrilling story with proper ups and downs,4,The Alchemist ' is a book for ones who love books of adventure and fantasy. This book was thrilling enough to keep you engaged with a tinge of fantasy. This book was so big and would take days long to be completed. You should be patient enough to read and understand the story. Cheers!!!
The Alchemist,Ardra sathyan,Book,4,Good one to read. The paper quality is second quality
The Alchemist,Yash Patel,Good Start For Biggners Reader,4,"It is good book to start your readinfg journey but not worth the hype its like a hindi Tells 'Bagal Me Chora , Gav Me Dhindhora'. But Yaa Its Good Book."
The Alchemist,Parul singh,Loved reading the book. Simple yet not so simple book.,4,A friend suggested me to read this book and I completed it in one go. The story literally flows and is gripping. I was really interested and invested in the main character's life. The book has helped me to understand few things and I look forward to reading more from Paulo Coelho.
The Alchemist,Lakshmikanth,MY REVIEW,4,"The booking is really Amazing. This book can be experientially understood by some one who has certain maturity and deep sense of vision towards life....life...the way it is! The book is a good example for spiritual intellectualism. Overally it's provides a good experience of reading. Coming to narration the author Paulo Coelho narrated in a way that we can even feel the characters , surroundings, the wind....etc. There are some sentences in the book that touches your heart and those are really amazing... In some instances the book shows the life from different philosophical perspectives. It is also a good book for beginners...so try it...."
The Alchemist,Sanjay Deb,"The Alchemist , a book about self beliefs and dreams",4,"The book is wonderful peice of literature, covering the very basic topics of life in form of a beautiful journey full of adventure and ups and downs , the moment one considers that the story is predictable the writer very cleverly brings out new angles and plots , it's a book which teaches us about our dreams and self belief that how everyone and everything have a pre defined role to play and a destiny to fullfill, only it is upto us how we reach to the realisation of that , we do or not , the book also has very beautifully imagined the sceneries of the different geographical locations it has mentioned along with the indeginious culture of each of the places. I would highly recommend this books especially to young minds as it teaches you soo many life lessons in the form of small anecdotes which will always help you out."
The Alchemist,Kumar Shivam,Good quality book with great lessons,4,The book arrived in very good quality. The seller #cloudtailindia provided authentic book. The lessons were life changing and have definitely changed my perspective . I'll request #amazon and all the sellers here to provide these kind of books at lower prices so that everyone can buy these and take benifit and change their lives.
The Alchemist,A. N. P,"Great book, When you feel low must read this book.",4,"It's great written and drafted, Good way to start the reading :) When you feel low or loosing confidence you must read it. Will change your mindset to see things differently."
The Alchemist,Gowrishankar S,Good book,4,Book with excellent information
The Alchemist,Vinay,Fairy tale with twist of philosophical touch,4,Nice read with simple imagination related with Arabic and Spanish cultural old stories. Wisdom of knowledge is rightly explained with simple analogy.
The Alchemist,Shreya Thakkar,Inspiring and motivating,4,"This book is a journey of self-discovery, fighting with your own demons, leading you through the threating roads of life. This book is not only philosophy but it is a manifestation of life! It tells us that life is not about the consequences and the destination but it's about the journey. This book can make you believe in power of thoughts. It can make one realises the true meaning of passion and dreams. Very few of us are lucky enough to be doing what we actually love. This book is a reminder for you to pursue your dreams and Live the Life you want. The author also puts a light on the thought that hard time don't last forever. Hardship is a test from the universe to see your strengths."
The Alchemist,Thanos,Page quality,4,"Allover book's condition is good as compared to other publishers,but still pages are very thin. So highlighters or markers can't be used "
The Alchemist,Neha,It's a great book .,4,I like this book by its story.
The Alchemist,Meher Unnisa,Great choice to read and good quality delivered.,4,Wanted this book from a really long time finally I bought it from Amazon and im satisfied with the quality and happy with the package it was ver safe I had ordered a paperback edition I really like paperback editions of books so I order every book in its paper back edition and the quality is really good. About the book if I speak then this is a fabulous book and a great experience to read. Altogether very happy.
The Alchemist,Akriti Sharma,About following your dreams.,4,Paulo coelho is an amazing writter. His writtings are so simple that anyone can understand it. So if you're new to reading and wanna start reading this book is totally for you. This book is about following your dreams and learning a lot in that process. You'll stumble you'll give up but after reading this you'll be motivated to achieve you're goals your dreams like the Sheppard did. A total motivational one. Just go for it I hope this helped you somehow.
The Alchemist,Pallavi Rai,Good one,4,It has been a great reading of mine and I recommend this to beginners for sure. 'The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho is an incentive to learn to achieve your goal despite the hurdles that come your way. This is the story of the Andalusian shepherd boy who dreams of traveling the world in search of a treasure where he met with the alchemist awaiting him in the Egyptian desert. It also brings your interest in reading if you are aiming to be a reader.
The Alchemist,Tirth,Easy to read book,4,"Good choice for beginner readers bcuz it's easy to read and also has less complicate words. Would recommend to some lost in his life and can't usually decide what to do? And also gives a brief explaination of following your dream in a beautiful manner. Only problem was that the story was to predictable for me, personally. Still recommend to read it!! ; )"
The Alchemist,Vilas Almeida,Good,4,Good
The Alchemist,Vaibhav,Worth money,4,Pages are of fair quality
The Alchemist,Mohammed Ubaid,I loved the book and the idea of being an Alchemist,4,"I have started reading during this lock down, so it means I am reading it in my complete free time which makes me understand this book better and better and would love to read this one again because this book gives you hope and courage and besides it teaches you what you should and shouldn't do to archive your goal and I bet you all that this story won't tell you to forget your dream not even for once somehow you will be able to connect yourself with the story and each of you will go through amazing experience. TRY NOW"
The Alchemist,Mohamed Riyas A. M.,A good read on fulfilling our dreams,4,"The book requires a kind of philosophical mindset and imagination to enjoy. The way the author presents his level of thinking is nice, but at many places I lost focus due to the way things are being presented. At the end when I finished reading it, it was quite an exhaustive at the same time satisfying trip I had with the author. Its a good read when you have a few hours to spare in a time of any sort of mental strain or emotional backlash. Thanks!"
The Alchemist,SR,A massive read.,4,"Product : The book arrived in its pristine condition - new, intact and laminated. Delivery : The book arrived as expected. The Book: The Alchemist has no doubt sold 65 M copies all over and reading the story halfway justifies it. The book is written in a fable form which keeps the continuity of the fable about Santiago, a shepherd who has a dream of a treasure in the pyramids of Egypt, and so sets out on a journey to the pyramids crossing Tarifa, Tangier, and Al-Fayoum, secured. With just a few words the reader is able to imagine the captivating scene. For the story, it's all pure philosophical wisdom which is bound to get brooding moments from the reader. A massive read."
The Alchemist,Seema Khandelwal,OK story but I didn't feel any connection,4,"Millions of people swear by this book so I ordered it. Finished it within 15 days but didn't really enjoy it. The story revolves around a mystical place and mystical characteristics. It does motivate you a bit but not as much as Paulo's 'Veronica decides to die' does. Veronica is also fiction but the story revolves around a familiar kind of person. You can actually related yourself. In Alchemist, you just read the boy's struggle but you won't feel connected. Nevertheless a good book."
The Alchemist,Malini,It is a thought-provoking & heartwarming tale,4,"The book follows the journey of Santiago, a young Andalusian shepherd, who dreams of discovering a treasure located near the pyramids in Egypt."

The Alchemist,Tushar Chauhan,novel,4,best novel
The Alchemist,DT.,A little disappointed with the cover.,4,The media could not be loaded. The book is in great condition and the pages are printed well but the cover is just a piece of paper that keeps coming off.
The Alchemist,Tribhuwan Kant Sharma,An indirect motivational self help book.,4,"We have so much exposure to the worldly things these days that a simple way of following instincts may or may not be possible. But pursuing ones Passion is clearly worth attempting, that's what the book says."
The Alchemist,Cool Buddy,A must read book for everyone.,4,I liked the content and the characters that appeared eventually as we moved forward in reading. I would recommend this book to everyone. This book contains some lines and learning highlighted by other readers too. I have learned great many things from this book. I urge my fellow readers to definitely go for this book without giving a second thought. It might not be that interesting from the beginning but Im sure you will have satisfaction and a smile on your face by the time youve finished reading.
The Alchemist,Bhaskar Prasad Reddy,Good book for beginners,4,Good book for beginners easy to understand.
The Alchemist,Ayushi laspal,Nice,4," The media could not be loaded. The condition of the book is good . And tbh I'm not totally into books and all but this book got my attention. I think this is one of the nicest book so far , I would recommend this for sure !"
The Alchemist,GN,4 stars only for condition of the product not the book,4,Buying the novelty edition should atleast make the book cover a bit better/protected? But it wasn't that bad and hence the 4 stars Otherwise this is one of my favorite books so I'm glad i got it
The Alchemist,Vibhootu,Alchemist comes with an easy language and straightforward description,4,"When it comes to motivational books its always among the top 10. Alchemist comes with an easy language and straightforward description. I know people who hate reading long descriptions about each and every scene and if you are one of them then you are going to love this book. It is a story about a shepherd young boy who chose a different path for his life irrespective of his parents interference.The story surrounds around this boy who followed his intuitions and walked the path of his dreams. It will lead you to a journey of dreams where there is love, lots of teachings, and offcourse the alchemist. I am not going to describe its full summary here as something should be left for the audience.Overall its a must have for your books collection ...!"
The Alchemist,Hardik,Chasing 'dream'- quite literally and figuratively,4,It's a fiction revolving around the Shephard as he travels to achieve his 'dream'- quite literally as well as figuratively. More about what keeps him going and power of that voice which runs behind you when there is a will. Someone might find a few content a bit superficial but I am not part of that pack.
The Alchemist,alok ranjan singh,Great narrative,4,"The theme and movement of the book is very captivating. It's a lucid flow of words that leads the reader to Utopian lands with the protagonist before the truth is finally revealed. Happiness dwells around us, we just need to follow our sixth sense to enjoy it. That's what the book teaches us. The ending is a bit abrupt in my views after a superb session of narration."
The Alchemist,MANOJ MISHRA,Learning comes through experience,4,"The story has been inspirational and stresses on a fact that an individual must listen to his and eventually she /he achieves what they want since the world conspires to make it work when you really want something. However, I believe some of the episodes were not really linked with main caharacters like daughter of a Baker in the begining etc."
The Alchemist,Gaurav,Inspiring and Thought Provoking,4,"The book is a blend of philosophy and fiction. The core message is philosophical which Coelho has spun around the story of a young shepherd. I really liked how Coelho talks about omens and personal legend. This has made me seriously rethink, my own personal legend and whether, I am following the omens left by the nature."
The Alchemist,Vivian Ronaldo,"To tell you the truth, it really is a good book.",4,"The Alchemist, for most people, is quite light to read, yet gives such a profound perspective to life, for a book that light. It tells a tale of generic premise: a young man chasing his dream, with not so generic experience, thought, and perspective. Favorite quote - You can become blind by seeing each day as a similar one. Each day is a different one, each day brings a miracle of its own. Its just a matter of paying attention to this miracle."
The Alchemist,Shubham Varshney,A great and interesting read,4,"I could relate this book to a lot of things in day to day life. The book sometimes motivates, in a certain way, to not give up in our quests. Although there were a few sections which felt a bit boring, hence a star drop in my rating. Overall it is a good read."
The Alchemist,Gopa Goswami,"Just finished reading this, really amazing but some parts are a bit unessesscery.",4,Very good book
The Alchemist,Nag,Great book for beginners,4,"Really interesting book, it will teach us many things, moreover we never feel bored after completing 30 percent of story."
The Alchemist,Nithya,Good book,4,"The quality of the pages is poor. As per the book, it's writing is simple and easy to understand. The story will be relatable for most of them who truly have a dream of achieving something"
The Alchemist,Harpreet Singh,The size is cute.,4,Good book condition.
The Alchemist,Shiva Reddy,"Content is excellent, but no Bookmark.",4,"At the beginning it's attractive, and in the middle i felt little booring, but i didn't stop reading, and when i completed the entire book, then i realised why this book is so famous. Its a story of a boy who had a dream. Its very attractive. But it will be more good if the book comes with Bookmark."
The Alchemist,Sandhya J.,A journey to remember!,4,Product quality- The pocket edition is really nice quality and a tiny book! Hence true to the description! Book- Ive read it long back! And its a book that showcases some real wise choices and decision making that in turn takes the character to an extremely beautiful place! Beautiful lines by Paulo coelho! Must have! (:
The Alchemist,Harrish,Good fiction book,4,It was a good book I dont know if it would be everyone's cup of tea but perhaps you can give it a try the author conveyed a message about dreams in a fantasy genre. And also a lot sayings about life and people and world
The Alchemist,James S.,Must Read Novel,4,This is the second time I'm purchasing this novel because this is one of the novels you have to have it in your life. Font size and Paper is okay. Its always good to buy from Amazon as delivery services are fast. Thanks Amazon.
The Alchemist,Harisha R,Good simple story but tittle lag,4,If you want to read a inspirational story with little patience go head. FINAL MESSAGE IS AWESOME
The Alchemist,Tusar agarwal,Good book to get some lessons for your life,4,Its just a motivational book
The Alchemist,Placeholder,Nice Book,4,The book is worth the time spend on reading it. Its a very good book. A must read for reader.
The Alchemist,Anynomous,Interesting,4,This book is really insightful. Although it is a fiction you will find a numbers of philosophy and it looks like the story or dialogue focus more on insight to our life
The Alchemist,DJA,The story is interesting,4,The story keeps you engrossed. Had a good time reading it though the story was fictional. Good book by the author.
The Alchemist,M Manju,No plastic at all.,4,First of all thank you for sending the product in good condition. I liked the packing. But I want to have less plastic in the package for book. It's ok if it has on cardboard packing. But the product should not be wet.
The Alchemist,Sijilesh.M,Good Product,4,Good product. i bought it for my niece aged 10. she loved this book.
The Alchemist,Sakshi T Kandwal,The super-duper combo of story and feel of the cover!,4,"Y'all know how good the book is. It's mesmerizing, apart from that the book is seemingly dead gorgeous. I bought the Novelty Book, it fits in my palm. The hardbound is strong and the cover looks remarkable. Go ahead and buy without any second thought."
The Alchemist,Santhanakrishnan,Good paperback product at this price,4,The media could not be loaded.
The Alchemist,K Sai thanush Reddy,Best book for gift for a adult,4,"Quality of a book is good , the content was nice , it is effort able to buy"
The Alchemist,Silpa Buragohain,Good for beginners,4,This is my first book..i have started reading books after this masterpiece..it taught me many life lessons
The Alchemist,Sushmita,A Book To Read,4,"For someone who is into the psychology of universe being one. This is a must read. The power of the universe and your subconscious mind is in general a non fiction topic, and mainly writers have covered it in the same genre. But with Alchemist, I love how Paulo Coelho sent the same message through an amazingly wrapped around story. It's short and too the point. Every page has something and you never go thinking 'what's the point of including this?' it's all important and it's all worth the read."
The Alchemist,Raktim B.,Enlighting and inapiring!!,4,"I am an admirer of Paulo coelho after reading this book. The messages given by the author through a very interesting story which can change ur life. The author has explained Why one should always follow his or her passion and should never give up and how God speaks to us through omens, and how the journey to our destiny makes us suitable for it."
The Alchemist,Placeholder,Good one.,4,"Book has things that our elders try to teach us from the time we learn how to speak to the time we start taking responsibilities. Anyone who wants to understand values of life, things around you, should read this."
The Alchemist,Shantanu Chakraborty,A MUST READ,4,"I have read this book three times and every time i found different meaning from this one, Secondly this is one of those books I have gifted a hell lots of friends. So this one is a big yes from me."
The Alchemist,ANVAR,Valuable Books,4,It should read eveyone
The Alchemist,Riya Tyagi,Worth it,3,Original one.
The Alchemist,READER,Bad packaging,3,Book is original but the packaging is very bad....also Amazon didn't sent even a single bookmark with this.....so disappointed
The Alchemist,Placeholder,Overrated,3,Bought just because of reviews and all. Chances are high that you it's essence from rest of internet.
The Alchemist,"You don't buy this book, this book choose you.",Meh,3,Was okay. From the beginning I always recommend Indian authors but gave it a try anyways. Good story. Can be carried while travelling
The Alchemist,Rudra Shankar Majumder,Not for me,3,I think it is overhyped but will not bore you. You can read one time
The Alchemist,PREET THAKUR,Nice read!!,3,"This story had a very calming tone to it. Despite being a very short story of fewer than 200 pages, it is filled with philosophical thoughts on life and biblical references. In this story, culture and religion are woven together in a very beautiful way. Even though it's not my genre (classic), I liked it a lot and it reads very quickly. This book is very well written and equally well translated into English. It keeps you intrigued and interested, and manages to inspire you. It is more of a self-help book, but the author conveys his message, point of view, and the reason why we should all keep following our dreams through a fictional story. A story about the world's soul, and coming back to where you started, but not the same."
The Alchemist,Vinesh,Paper quality is not good,3,Paper quality of this book is yellowish and cheap
The Alchemist,Aman Dewangan,nice But expected more!,3,A nice book! Ive heard a lot about this book it is kind of philosophical in approach i found it is good but not as per Ive heard! Good for me But best for the person who loves philosophical theories.
The Alchemist,Durba Ghosh,Good one time read but Overhyped,3,Rating : 3.5/5 I went in trying to see why this book was so famous. I still dont get it tbh. This is mostly like self help book written in fictional backdrop that centres around men (maybe because of the age and culture or maybe the writer is patriarchal) and their pursue of legend. I liked the first half but the second half after he met the alchemist just sounded like explanation of different proverbs and phrases i have been hearing since childhood. It didnt teach me anything new or present with anything different. So I dont get the hype
The Alchemist,Krishna,One of my favorite,3,"The quality of the paper is not much good but it's okay.Font size of the para is readable but when the words in a paper are written very thick then it's problematic to read and in this most of the times you'll see this kind of trend (only some pages are not too much bold/thick but they are plain and readable).So my endping point is that paper quality is not much good and sometimes you may get headache. Talking about the book is it's amazing to read and each page of the book is worth to read it again for full motivation basically which lifts you in the mood of positivity,and you'll start to ask some fascinating questions about yourself and the the world.It sometimes moves you in the zone of spirituality but everyone has their ideal of worship to follow to reach the destination hub.I've got some favorite quotes from the book that are Worth mentioning but here I'll disclose only one : 'If you can concentrate always on the present,you'll be a happy man.life is the moment we're living right now'. Finally The book should be in your bookshelf."
The Alchemist,Dineshwar,The Alchemist: A Modern Fable of Self-Discovery ',3,The quality of the paper is not same As mentioned.. And overall the quality is average iam not totally satisfied by the package delivered..
The Alchemist,Chidvilasini,Good philosophical read,3,Good philosophical read but little lagged after completing 60%. I recommend this book for new readers as the author wrote the book in simple and understandable language.
The Alchemist,Ravi sahni,Amazing,3,Not read yet completely but quality of pages are good
The Alchemist,Harshit Sharma,Read it and had a decent time doing so.,3,"Well, I finally decided to give in to the peer pressure around this thing. There was an offer and hence, got this via a speedy delivery from Amazon (thanks for that!) Coming to the book. I think the moment you hold it in your hands and notice its appealing cover, you see the 65 millions copies sold and naturally your expectations skyrocket. Thats what went wrong for me! The people around me, that tag line, they all created a lot of build up around this book. Coming to the reading experience, it is nice to say the maximum. Its not going to touch you, or move up deeply. I mean dont get me wrong here, the narrative is nicely painted. But like many of Paulos work, its a drag, at times. And this short story could have been more crisp. The ending-the last 4 pages- is the real deal of the book. The prior 150 ones are not. Its a good book to read. And I would recommend it to any and all if they are into spiritual books. Thanks."
The Alchemist,Amazon Customer,Journey of the boy,3,It was good to read the journey of the boy and travel along. The story line is simple but dragged beyond limits. The entire books philosophical touch wasn't so strong to reach me.
The Alchemist,SAINATH REDDY,The lessons are good but the story sucks,3,"The philosophy was good ,the hurdles which everybody encounter in the way of pursuing their own dream is to test them which is a fact. This book made me disappointed as I expected more from it because of the fame it has. The story sucks but the lessons are to be learned from it which are -&gt; follow your heart, heed the voice of it. -&gt; everything in life has it's price -&gt; Life is the moment we are living now -&gt; It's not what enter's men's mouths that's evil, it's what comes out of their mouths that is. -&gt; No project is completed until it's objective has been achieved. This are the some of the lessons which everyone should learn, although I don't believe in conspiring of whole world for your dream it's just the thought of whole universe having your back will make your strength and you just tends to push yourself towards your goal."
The Alchemist,Rahul Rajan,Nice,3,Weight less
The Alchemist,A.M.D.,Don't believe the hype. Ok read.,3,"I found it to be an ok read. Nothing amazing as the reviews mention. Very draggy and childish story. I mean, I get the inner meaning and all, but nothing that invokes profound thoughts or emotions. Felt like it was written in a hurry and at times you may feel that the author couldn't really figure out how to move the story forward. Abrupt scene changes without proper explanation and things like that. Read it just because it's a famous book. You may do the same. :)"
The Alchemist,Sahil Sihag,Not good Not bad but less interesting while reading.,3,"This book is highly recommend everywhere and everyone says this is one of the best books. But I found it differently, I haven't enjoyed reading it like other books. The story is less interesting. Moreover, I also felt boredom in the middle of the story. All people says it gives us best lessons of life and so on but in my case I didn't got any single lesson . Maybe it demands high level of understanding skills or something else which I don't have."
The Alchemist,Pradeepta Nayak,um,3,"Not everyone will enjoy it. This book was too philosophical for my liking. It wasn't the book's fault tho. People who like to read deep books should go for this. While I like dark books, suspense/crime and YA books, I don't read books of this genre. If you like books like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, then go for The Alchemist. If you're more of a Princess Diaries, One Of Us Is Lying, Harry Potter and Divergent person, then don't go for this unless you like motivational/philosophical reads. Great book, but just not fit for me. xxx"
The Alchemist,Ranjith,Mixed feelings,3,"Its a pocket sized book Hardcover with dust cover which was damaged little bit Page and paper quality s too good. No illustrations ,only 1 map"
The Alchemist,YUVRAJ SINGH PATEL,Stained and torned,3,The media could not be loaded. Recieved the book today. There was some sort of stain at the bottom end of the spine and the spine end it was little torn.
The Alchemist,raghuram,It was good but a bit too dramatic,3,"Ofcourse it's a fantasy and inspirational to follow your dream or what the book calls a 'personal legend', but I didn't see the value that people see and revere. It's a good story but at times we can't help but feel, it's stretched a bit too far. There are definitely good take aways from this read."
The Alchemist,Reading_Tamishly,For beginners and school going readers.,3,"One of those books which I read for the first time during my school days and I was happy with. Now I am thinking about it, I do not think I understood the book much then. Would I recommend this book? Yes, for beginners and school going kids. However, I would say the older readers would not gain much out of the book."
The Alchemist,Kindle Customer,It was decent,3,The book was somewhat dry as the protagonist was just simply following the omens without using his own conscience. It could have been better
The Alchemist,Chandrasekar M,Not appealing to person with mid life crisis,3,"As someone undergoing mid life crisis I am in a phase where I am at cross roads searching for my personal legend so naturally this book came highly recommended for me, even though I was able to relate all the way with the story after reading the book I give it 3 stars because of dryness in narration and some gaps in the story line."
The Alchemist,Anmol,One time read.,3,"Those who want to read philosophy and intelligent book, this is for them. I personally didn't like it but yes it is one of the most popular book for 2 decades. As everyone thinks 'it must be having something worth reading'. Well it has. But I didn't like it that much. It gives you life lessons in very different manner. Yes it is one time read."
The Alchemist,Ramsai,Pleasant read,3,"Pleasant read with lot of human sentiments. Story narrated what are distractions and motivations to work for personal legend. Some of the aspects of story are not practical, but carried the underlying message well"
The Alchemist,Chanbir,Good book but,3,Its a great book but seller is selling pirated copy
The Alchemist,Irfhan buhari,Positivity,3,"Feels like a journey of positivity.. See the goodness and experience u had in ur life instead of worrying about the things which went wrong and failures at every stage.. Chase your dream.. Never give up.. One day you will see your trophy of success for all the hurdles you have been and also for not giving up easily.. This book's lesson can be compared with our real life experiences; also we can learn all the positivity, morals, and lessons from this fiction philosophy story of a Boy's journey towards his dream..!"
The Alchemist,Arun S,Decent read,3,Decent storybook. More or less like The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. A bit disappointed that it didn't motivate me in any way.
The Alchemist,Prabhleen Kaur,A very different approach than main stream novels. I have kind of mixed feelings about this one.,3,"Well, this book has a collection of some really good quotes and opinions. Among which some might even force you to think about the aspects of life in a way never thought or seen before but, the use of literature and story line is just so unique and below average that it just doesn't hold your attention to let you stick to the book, it doesn't ignite that feeling of longing for more and more; and moreover, the ending was quite abrupt as per the rest of the context. So 3/5 from me."
The Alchemist,Riya,Nice book,3,Nice perspective
The Alchemist,Kindle Customer,Good,3,Good read. There is always something you learn about life while you read this book. Book is well written in simple words.
The Alchemist,Sneha Acharya,"Inspiring, yet archaic.",3,"Applying the lessons I learnt from this book in the modern, current world is quite impossible. I think I need to read it a few more times to get its essence and to understand how it is applicable even in today's world."
The Alchemist,Pragya Gautam,OverHyped,3,The writing style of the author is very good. But the overall read was a bit overhyped. This does not cross the expectations though you can have a read.
The Alchemist,Harshita,Ok ok type,3,I like this book it is good . This book is more about following our heart ....thr is also how universe talk to us . It is story type book .
The Alchemist,P R,Nice,3,Good one
The Alchemist,Amarjit Singh Arora,Confusing,3,Well this book is articulated very well to convey life lessons in a dramatic way. At the end and in the epilogue it was really confusing. Climax is not properly articulated as I feel.
The Alchemist,Chau Sunaka Moungkang,Not the best,3,"It's a good book but didn't like the story much, it was like a flop fantasy movie( like the Last Air bender or the scorpian king) and also there was so much rave about this book so I expected more."
The Alchemist,amit naryal,Decent quality,3,"Earlier, I received a used book. Print quality was good. On replacement, received new book with decent print quality. Go for it."
The Alchemist,Nikita,Pages are missing,3,Book shows it has172 pages...but after 155 page there are3 blank pages ..then from page 159tillpage 161 printed story..and the book story ends here till 161...... where is the rest 11 pages??? Given 3 stars just for the love of the Alchemist.....11 pages are missing from my book..
The Alchemist,Yuvraj singh,Hardcover edition is very small,3,Good book...
The Alchemist,Sreerag V S,Easy Read,3,It is an easy read which can be finished in a sitting. This may not be as soulful as 11 minutes. But it does have the soul of a young adventurous boy.
The Alchemist,Rutvik,Vool,3,Nice to read
The Alchemist,sami,Good book. But its smell bad,3,Book is ok. But its smell very bad
The Alchemist,NISHTHA GUPTA,Must read this book,3,I brought this book as kindle edition and started reading it during my travel time i just love this book it inspires me alot
The Alchemist,Asish,You get what you pay for.,3,"The book was slightly folded in the middle, like someone has used it, or it might have been the shipping ( I strongly believe it's the first one). Either way I got the book."
The Alchemist,SHOBHA RANI K,Good one,3,Although this book conveys a great message Im not really a fan of it because the story is too far from reality.
The Alchemist,Shriesty,Content,3,Paperback is very light and smooth like novel and the paper texture is fine....but overall this one was average..as content I guess 161 pages and rest interview of author pablo coelho please provide bookmarks
The Alchemist,Prudhvi kumar,Interesting but not useful.,3,This is my second book. I don't recommend this book for those readers who wish to gain knowledge and wisdom. You don't get inspired by this book in anyway. But the content never loses your curiosity and interest. I completed this in 2 days. I don't find anything useful from this book as this is a fictional story but I enjoyed when I was reading this.
The Alchemist,Jayesh Thakur,Good Book for Begineers,3,"If you are avid book reader then you might find this book mediocre.If you are beginner then this book is for you.this book is saga of a boy searching for treasure and following his dreams,It is good books for kids for motivation. it is translated book from Spanish language so may lack originality of paulo's wording."
The Alchemist,Arjith Babu,Made with low quality paper,3,"This is not the original version of the book, its printed on cheap paper. Well you can still read the story, the printing is clear. Its worth for 120rs"
The Alchemist,Riya Sharma,If you are only concerned about reading...Go ahead and grab one!,3,I received the book today! The quality of pages is not good. Plus it's so sad to see there ain't any book marks! With Paulo Coelho every novel I received one.
The Alchemist,Anand J,A decent book,3,I didn't really like the Preaching parts of the story.Apart from that a good book. Go for it. Not bad
The Alchemist,Swati Agrawal,Nice Book,3,"Its a nice book, but sometimes its very slow in pace and repetitive which reduces the interest"
The Alchemist,Vijay Kumar,Impressive,3,"Paper quality is poor, but content is best."
The Alchemist,Tabrez Mansuri,Seems to be clueless,3,Excited to read it before buying but not much adventure after reading it.
The Alchemist,Abhilash,A fun read,3,Not bad but not that great either. Felt like reading some short story from Balarama. Its enjoyable but I don think its worth this much hype all over the world.
The Alchemist,Rajni dimri,Content is good but paper quality is not,3,Poor quality paper i think it's photo copy of the original one really disappointed
The Alchemist,Sam George,Ok ok..,3,Average
The Alchemist,Jibesh,Not that great (for me)!,3,"This book must be good because many liked it, but for me it was a bit boring. Wisdom and spiritual talks aren't my cup of tea. Climax was good but most of the time i felt bored. I love action. Thoughts and philosophical knowledge goes right past my head!"
The Alchemist,Shiva R,Interesting concept. But some parts felt repetitive and stretched,3,"Interesting concept. But some parts felt repetitive and stretched. Overall, this book is inspiring. Contains some useful insights ... mainly focusing on that fact that even through tough times, we need to learn and move forward"
The Alchemist,Aditi Sarkar,So-so,3,Everything was ok but the book seemed a little dirty. Dirty in the sense there were some black spots on the book. As a new book I do not wish this kind of thing. Else everything is fine.
The Alchemist,Kishann,Okay,3,Well completed half of the book but not sure it could not create that suspense forcing u complete the book...may be i heard a lot abt the book that lost my interest on the contant
The Alchemist,Neeraj Gupta,Hindi Translation - Not up to the mark,3,"I have read this book both in English (the original book) and the translated Hindi version. The Hindi translation is not up to the mark, seems they have used google translate or some other translating tool and tried to put the words. Even at some places, there are some typos. If you have ever read translated Russian books from 1970s / 1980s era from Mir, Raduga etc. you will find a significant dip in the quality of translation especially choosing the right word in the translated language (Hindi)."
The Alchemist,Kei,A Captivating Story,3,I really liked the writing style of Paulo Coelho. The story kept me curious throughout the entire book. It's a unique story about attaining your personal legend. A good book to jump into if you're a beginner reader.
The Alchemist,Anyonomous,I found the fond a little weird.,3,The package and everything was quiet safe only thing was the font . Yet it is readable
The Alchemist,Abhishek Singh,"Average book, idk why it is so overrated.",3,"Average book, idk why it is so overrated. 3/5 is perfect for this book. It's not a 'must read' book."
The Alchemist,sv,Just so,3,I was quite impressed with the sea gull story _ Jonathan the sea gull which learnt to let go and fly. I don't see any inspiration such that. I don't appreciate the take home message from this book as relevant and guiding in life. Just mystic and fantasy. Don't know it remains a best seller.
The Alchemist,CHETHAN k.,No bookmark,3,Yet to read but ik it's awesome book n that's why I bought but bookmark is missing I didn't expected that
The Alchemist,PB,Good,3,Slightly faded dust jacket.
The Alchemist,Albert Thomas,Ok,3,"Paper quality is very poor,even print is not proper"
The Alchemist,Misal,Story of the book is OK type.,3,As I heard about the book but the story is ok type. But the story really help you to sort out your problem related to your dreams.
The Alchemist,Sheikh Mubarak,Amazon.... Take care of the book paking...,3,The book is soooo tiny Bad paking I got the dots on book
The Alchemist,Kanishka,Worth reading,3,"The journey is Good. Somehow lost the grip, when the desert journey started after the crystal sales business. Finding Alchemist is interesting, but the pre-climax is too dramatic and overflowing conversations. Bit unimpressive there, but soon the climax part is good. I like the way his dream and journey ended. 'Follow your dreams.. ' Worth reading book"
The Alchemist,IMRAN,"Only online book ,it is.",3,I wanted a hard copy. How do I get it. Is kindle just a online reading stuff?
The Alchemist,Anshika Pandey,Good,3,The most heard book. There is a flood of people who are reading it or read it before. Good start for a beginner reader.
The Alchemist,Sahil Nagpal,First Ever Paul Coelho I read,3,The story was pretty good. It dictates to follow our personal legend and try to understand the omens occurring in our daily life Book is worth a one time read atleast.
The Alchemist,Raghuram,Ok for a 1 time read,3,"I had read this book some 10 years back and was blown away. Now when I came back to this book after having read many more books in the same genre, this books seems like a let down. I guess I am looking for something more concrete than 'maktub'! The last 5 pages of the book are still very engaging. A big positive for this book is that it is very small and can be read in 1 sitting."
The Alchemist,Bindi Dave,Packing was not good,3,The packing was not good at all...it was little bit open and book was not covered by plastic.
The Alchemist,Lizz Bennett,Didn't like it,3,Bought it due to multiple recommendations.Personally didn't like it . If u believe in omens and other stuff you make like it.
The Alchemist,Lohit Peesapati,Too hyped...,3,"The Alchemist talks about the journey of a shepherd boy to Egypt for a treasure hunt(wow!! great). The first few pages are very well written, then he goes to Africa and meets an old man (still good), then starts the destiny thing (it's there from the start, but not that stupid). The writing becomes too repetitive and I didn't feel bad at the end nor satisfied."
The Alchemist,Dileep,May be I am not mature enough to learn from this story,3,I know it is a story of highly motivating but for a normal person like me it is not more than a story. I couldn't able to interpret what author is trying to convey. Anyway when i read this book it brings a new person out of me who wants to open his ears and listen to the language of world.
The Alchemist,Shabbir Ahmed,Readable,3,Readable
The Alchemist,Amazon Customer,average story,3,"Its not a self help book if you are looking for. Not a book that hooks you till the last page, but still a good read for an optimist. Writer tries to explain how universe work for you to help you reach your destiny but does not leave you satisfied with the end."
The Alchemist,Anand,Good insight into life goals.,3,"It is an engrossing read no doubt. The story/fantasy format used to explain the pursuit of ones life goal is quite interesting. While it is not the greatest book I ever read, I'd love to read it again in some time!"
The Alchemist,Upendra Singh,"Fine story, Not great.",3,"I did not feel the story so overwhelmingly inspiring or interesting as is the hype. Some moments in the story, though, are stimulating just like any other motivational writing. But still that may be a personal view and may differ for different people. Overall, it is a good book."
The Alchemist,Dr.SRINIVAS,Good,3,Good
The Alchemist,Sandra Maria Duarte,It is okay,3,"This book is so famous, I guess I was expecting more from it. I already knew the teachings on this book."
The Alchemist,PKA,Just OK,3,OKish
The Alchemist,George,Average self improvement book...,3,"If u have read similar books it seems to be an average one compared to the likes of - the monk who sold his Ferrari, the last lecture and when breath becomes air ...."
The Alchemist,VivekRoy,One of the best books I've ever read,3,One of the best books I've ever read.. The story is adventures N a lot interesting.. But the paper quality of the book was worst.. Didn't expect this from amazon.. Not satisfied.. Overall the book is just awesome...
The Alchemist,Abhishek T G,Poor paper quality,3,Poor paper quality
The Alchemist,Purva,Too preachy for my taste.,3,"I tried reading this genre of book for the first time and though it is a quick read, it is very boring (at least for me)"
The Alchemist,vaseem,A book which keeps me going .....,3,"A book which kept me moving , moving and moving forward, the way paulo has portrayed is best feeling in the world , I like his words related to heart ......."
The Alchemist,Nikhil,Not a must read,3,Bought it due to the hype everyone was Bragging about. Didn't find anything interesting and worth it
The Alchemist,mango21445,"First 60% of the book is extremely good, then tapers off",3,"First 60% of the book is extremely good, then tapers off, even becoming a bit silly towards the end. Yet, I feel blessed for ordering this book! Must read at least once in life."
The Alchemist,Murtaza Farosh,Inspirational but at some point boring,3,"The story is inspirational, has suspense, excitement but at some places it becomes a little too surreal. Like the part where the lead character speaks to the Sun, wind and sand."
The Alchemist,akshat,Not a hard binding as expected,2,"I ordered library binding but I got very common binding. Not as expected. Should have been hard cover and the front book picture is also not as shown in the description of this book. When a book lover orders a book, its not only the contents but the over all book also. This is a feeing and connection with your book."
The Alchemist,mansi bhatt,Quality is really cheap.,2," The media could not be loaded. This review is not regarding the content but the quality of the product recieved. I don't know if it's a used book that I've got or is it just the terrible printing that makes it appear as one. Printing is literally third quality, the page texture is rough and thin. It doesn't have proper binding, the pages are just glued together and that even not properly. As soon as i turned the first page, it fell out of the book and then another one. I'm seriously disappointed with the product. Talking about the book content - You should just go for it. You can see the brilliant writing, hard work and dedication put into the book that makes it one of the best book to be read."
The Alchemist,Rudra,Okayishh,2,Had so much potential.. wasted it in doing mumbo-jumbo... Totally disappointed..
The Alchemist,Ashly,Nothing great as the reviews suggest,2,"The book is an extremely slow and boring read, and rambles on and on about omens, about following your destiny, about 'knowing' right and wrong, and so on. I didn't really get what the author is trying to convey, nor did I feel that it was a 'motivating' or a 'feel good' book. Read it only if you want to say that you've read it!"
The Alchemist,krishna Kumar,Story I couldn't digest,2,"This book was in my reading list for long time due to peers suggestion, and finally I bought thia book. Generally, I keep my distance with self help books, and I wish would have kept the distance with this book so. Many may not be amused with this review, even I am not feeling good in posting a poor review for the book which has very high recommendation, this what this is. In the most parts, book will seem very promising, after sometime I realised there is no real deal here. All talks no substance"
The Alchemist,Aaditya,Not worth the hype.,2,People giving 5 stars jst to look cool. Othrwise it is just a 2 star book. Many characters are unnecessary with zero background. Fiction at its worst
The Alchemist,Ishfaq Ahmad,the book is more advertisement of the author and his works than the story itself.,2,"a good motivational fable to realise &amp; persue your dream.. a short story of just one day's read written in simple &amp; comprehensive lines.. And that's it.. nothing more or extraordinary.. the book has received a superfluous hype &amp; attention.. the book is overpriced and is available offline on cheaper prices.. the piece i received speaks more about the author than the content itself.. dozens of pages at the front &amp; many more at the end just added for the advertisement of the other books of the author.. author name mentioned everywhere, at the top of each page, at the the front, at the end everywhere.. so much of self-apprisal .. surprisingly, the name of the central character 'Santiago' is mentioned only once in the entire book.."
The Alchemist,Rakesh roy,Not the best quality,2,The packaging of the book was poorly done and when I took off the plastic the colours came off like this. The pages are of lower quality too
The Alchemist,RAY,Not worth it,2,"I feel like quotes used in this book are meaningless, if your planning to buy a adventure book this isn't for you."
The Alchemist,Dijo George,Most overrated book,2,Suggestable for a primary school student
The Alchemist,Tanish Katial,Overrated,2,"Just an average book, not much to learn."
The Alchemist,Arijit das,Quality,2,book paper quality is very bad
The Alchemist,Adithya,Not worth the hype,2,"After many recommendations online, and looking at reviews as many people suggesting to read i prefered to read and realized half way through the book, and thought is it really making sense to continue or stop reading it further. Anyway i continued and read it till the end and realized its a crap with nonsensical and contrived story of a boy in pursuit of finding a treasure. Why author has to go through all superstitions like boy talking to sand, wind, sun and about soul of the world all unwanted things to explain the importance of realizing one's dreams."
The Alchemist,Amazon Customer,Not received in good condition,2,Book received was not in good condition
The Alchemist,manish,This book board me,2,"Start of the story is good but when you reach at end, then i felt it was bit boring"
The Alchemist,MD Farhan Arshad,Poor condition,2,Corners of book was not in good condition.
The Alchemist,Rushita,"Overrated, not up-to my expectations",2,"I don't know why people are overrating this book, to be honest it turned down my expectations which I had before reading it. I bought it thinking it is the bestseller, but yeah, not up-to my expectations. People who like philosophy and etc can go for it."
The Alchemist,Omkar,A complete BS story for a mid 30s person,2,"Not sure whether all the reviews I read were from kids but this book is completely overrated.

The Alchemist,Prolific Reader,Did not meet expectations,2,I heard much about this book since it was a huge international bestseller. But I discovered this is not my kind of book.

The Alchemist,Rani,Copy of book is not ok. Page no missing.,2,"This book is really awesome. It is not story what you follow, but narration about situations. Except the copy delivered had page no mentioned upto 135. Next pages didn't had page no mentioned. Got this as a gift for my friend...will exchange it for sure"
The Alchemist,Sid,Much hype about nothiing,2,"Well, first thing first, its not everyday you get your hands on a book whose 60 million copies have been sold and that no. In itself is so huge that you wouldn't bother to read reviews before ordering it(Neither did I). But let me tell you a different perspective, I found this book just average. And I don't want to discredit the author for that, I am just saying that teachings of this book may sound very repetitive and outdated. However this is my personal view and I know many genuine people who have read this book will agree with me on this one. But I know this will not stop you from buying this book. So go ahead and find it yourself."
The Alchemist,Uma Rajendiran,Average,2,"Average storyline contents, no recommended for expected viewers"

The Alchemist,Jash Suthar,Recieved damaged product,2,The media could not be loaded. Recieved damaged product. Had to initiate replacement.
The Alchemist,Magadevan Ramalingam,Dragging book with philosophy of life,2,"Tha author could've written just the conversations between the people which would have cut off dragging or boring feeling that I had. Unnecessary portions spoilt the good content. Perhaps Spanish to English translation added fuel to fire. Anyways good one for one time read, if one's patient enough ;)"
The Alchemist,PB,Good service but bad reading experience,2,"My buying experience with Amazon was good but the book was not up to my expectations. Personally, I am not a fan of philosophy. I don't understand what is this book so famous for."

The Alchemist,Prince neo,Motivational but religious advertisement.,2,"This one is best of all story I guess to inspire the people through writing. But after reading half of this book turns out it is totally religious baised. Writer made statement in each and every page which directs our attention to some specific religion. Story was good , inspirational and will give u a boost of energy to think and work Ur odds out. Except religious view which writer tried imprint on us."
The Alchemist,Priyanshu,Do not expect too much!!,2,"It's just a fair read which just go on which finally upheaval your all senses demanding when it gonna end. I felt it's just not today;s read maybe back in 1998 people prefer but no not now. Sorcery, religion, magic and all were the preoccupying contents of this book. The worst thing was that the protagonist keep cheering himself reciting the sayings of a so called king that he met. It's just like a literature chapter of the high school which is illicit to publish coz it is too big. Rather than this go for looking for Alaska."
The Alchemist,GOLU,Very average and boring,2,"The delivery from amazon was on time,but the book sucked. I usually complete this large book within 4-5 hours and it took the same numbers of days or even more. The way the book is written certainly is very poor. It's boring too;I took 4-5 days to complete it. This was my first book from Paulo Coelho and I'm never reading any of his other books. I've seem many people talking about how their life changed or something and I just sucked up those comments. I wouldn't ever suggest anyone to read the book. Definitely, A big NO."

The Alchemist,Amit Verma,Most over hyped book ever,2,This is a very overrated book full of fictional story of a boy who goes in search of a treasure he dreamt of. Here we all know how realistic this book is. The kind of learning and message author wants to give here is just his personal view. Apart from the boy in the book the Author himself is a dreamer and totally relies on it. If you want to save your time just read his interview at the end of this book. After that you will not dare to read this book.
The Alchemist,K Kapoor,Two Stars,2,Overrated
The Alchemist,Suneeta,Seems used and old,1,"I recieved the book torn, I'm raising replacement query "
The Alchemist,Kindle Customer,Overrated,1,Overhyped and overrated..
The Alchemist,Ashutosh K.,This book is a pain and disdain,1,"Bad, bad and very badly written book. Literary content is poor and it never excites you. The story line is jerky and full of moral clichs that adds nothing new to your experience. Its popularity can be attributed to the fact that the story tries very hard to invoke senseless morality which is well known and acceptable to the masses. So people with poor taste when read it they are able to think, 'oh yes! he is right. I heard that before. So nice!' I swayed away by the popularity and I promise not to read any Paulo Coehlo book ever in life. I never liked such fable or story books because hardly any author ever met my intellectual expectations. But I thought let's give it a try and it turned out a huge turn off. Also the story line is in the form of third person which I don't like as it disconnects you from the book. Just think of all great statements on morality that people talk in general. Blend it with a childish story of dreams. Here you go the 'Alchemist ' book is ready. Don't buy it you will just waste your money. Since you are here to buy a book I would suggests you to move on before you buy because of some silly reviews of its greatness and number of copies sold. Believe me, the level of language appreciation among population is very bad these days. Also, consider buying the great short stories of Leo Tolstoy also available in Amazon. One story of that book is way worth than one million useless books like this one."
The Alchemist,Ravikumar P,some pages are blank,1,"i got a defective book, where some pages are missing/not printed."
The Alchemist,Priyanka M,meaningless read,1,"The Alchemist is a tale that whirls around a certain Andalusian shepherd boy, Santiago, a dreamer, traveller, and enthusiastic learner. The novel is about this boy and how his decisions, hardships he faces, all the things he learns take him to places. And aid him along his path to discover the quest he is on and untangle the mysteries of his recurring dream. Along his way, he meets various strangers who provide him with stories and insights about life and the world. He gains wisdom, courage, and confidence, which at several times helped him to move forward towards his dream. This story provides different takeaways to different people and for me, it was the middle ground as this fable started getting monotonous stating that the entire universe conspires to help you achieve what one desires. All the parts of the story where the author talks about Soul of the World, language of the world and listens to your heart seemed ridiculous while reading. But at the same allows one to be a dreamer and motivates them to learn from their surroundings."
The Alchemist,Sivasankar Balakrishnan,Too much hype for nothing,1,"I bought the book because of all the great reviews people wrote and because it was recommended by so many people I personally know. I sat down and read the whole book in one sitting hoping to get something useful out of it and feel better after reading it. I got nothing from the book. Absolutely nothing. It didn't make me feel better, enlightened, or glad that I spent those hours reading it. I would not read it again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know. The book has some good ideas in there but they're all tainted with some spiritual new age nonsense. It's not realistic advice and won't help you with everyday life. The story is bearable, but at times waaay too crazy. I can't even compare it to a fable because there isn't an overlying message to the story as with the cute little stories you would have heard when you were little. That being said, if you want to read about a Shepard in some ancient land who goes on an adventure, order the book. If you want advice and some good message, look elsewhere."
The Alchemist,Akhilesh Singh,"Not bad, but overhyped",1,"The book is completely male oriented and advertises a particular faith. In the whole book, you will never find a female in an important contributing role, only veiled dependent Arab women . More of a vague and fiction book. Definitely not the best and is overhyped"
The Alchemist,Joy rawat,Pages are missing!!,1,The media could not be loaded. This copy of the book is missing pages from 65 to 80. Also pages 51 to 64 are being repeated twice.
The Alchemist,IbnBatuta,Extremely overrated,1,"I read a lot of books, not by modern authors so much. This book has become a hygiene now for readers. I found it super overrated. As the story builds, there is no certain message, it's more like adding one thing on top of another without a cohesive line. The language itself is very ordinary, which is ok but I couldn't even visualize anything while reading, no immersive feel at all. I don't recommend it at all."
The Alchemist,Mehtab Singh,It sucks,1,"Worst book i ever read. Its story about a boy had a dream about treasure. He went to find that treasure with the help of omens lol. When i thought this couldn't go more ridiculous after 80% book is read, wind and sun starts to talk. Shuk what is happening here. In reach the place where he is supposed to find the treasure which is Egypt. Guess what treasure is in the same place he dreamt about it . Wastage of time, have pity on yourself and read something better. Book fully of superstitions. I mean man just stay away"
The Alchemist,Jaseel,Missing and scrambled pages,1,The book is of low quality but that's expected considering the dirt cheap pricing. What's not expected are several missing pages and pages scrambled all over the place.

Think and Grow Rich,Sanchit,A life changing book. Period.,5,"What else could you buy for 70 and expect it to change your life? Not a lot of things, right? Well, this book just does that. Written over 80 years ago, the knowledge given in this book in every page of it still holds true. The book's main idea is about 'Earning money' but the tips and tricks given in the book are not just limited to that; they could literally be applied to anything. College life; work routine; business; school, anything. The author talks about small little things, like, consistency, burning desire, subconscious mind, and so many other ideas which we already know about, but he tells us how to implement them correctly, and how they hold the potential to change you completely. While reading you would come across so much knowledge that you would have to write it down, and once you do, ponder over it and feel the change, literally. Go ahead, buy this book. RATING: 5/5 DELIVERY: 5/5"

Only thing, that the product that I received, one of the pages was hampered. I could still read, but being a collector, I did not like the idea of a page being damaged."
Think and Grow Rich,Anit Lyngwa,A user's manual,4,The secret to this book is re-reading it over and over again until it is embedded in your system and actually realise that the things you are doing in the moment are actually borrowed from the book more like a user manual. A one time read won't get you results the fire will extinguish. Keep the flame raring on.

Best book to learn about manipulation and to destroy your opponents in your life",Money book !!,4,Want to know about world and money this book is for you . Napoleon sir has added there experience and leaning in this which will help you to reach next level in life
Think and Grow Rich,Vcreators,Think and Grow Rich is not worthy for the 21st Century.,3,"You know why Think and Grow Rich is not worthy enough to read in the 21st Century. Is because we have a lot of Quick Rich Scheme. We all use Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, and Amazon and other useful tools for connecting with each other and sharing what we like. And I found more useful information on Youtube than in Think and Grow Rich. I have already started watching self-help content on Youtube, Subscribed some of the top richest men of this era, so I somehow already developed a mindset about what to do in my life and how to make money Online was my top search. And I was new to this book reading world so I searched some of the books to get rich and all there were so many videos who claim that You must start with Think And Grow Rich. Finally, I bought this book and started reading during this lockdown. Nothing to do, no study, no college till further notice, so I started with an Autobiography of Sachin Tendulkar and then began reading think and grow rich. After reading for around 60-70 pages I found this boring, philosophical, and full of useless theory. I pushed hard myself because of this lockdown no other way to pass my time, so I have to read it full. And finally, the day came when I finished this book. Now after around 3 months of reading it. I come to a conclusion that this book is all about developing a mindset but you won't able to connect what the author is saying because I failed to connect. So it's your choice but if you still want to read this book let me know your views after reading it. And if you want to connect with Like-Minded people - message me on (7987490561)"

Think and Grow Rich,Ahmad Karimi,Three stars,3,Meaningful
Think and Grow Rich,Vikas Jayna,valuable concepts but the content is dated,3,The book gives a good insight as to what changes someone needs to bring about in him or herself to attract money. But at the same time would like to caution that this book was written almost a 100 years back and hence all the examples of successful people date back to those days. There is nothing in the book related to today's times like the digital age etc. Also the book is a lengthy read and I feel the same stuff can be conveyed in much lesser words. Also the book uses quite a few words that at least I had never come across and hence had to reach out frequently to the internet searching for their meaning.
Think and Grow Rich,Sandeep M.,Thanks,3,Thanks

Think and Grow Rich,Anand Patel,About Imprint,2,Book is very good Print and paper is good But font is too small...if you see the images of book in review you can see that in printing they print very small and give border space too much(almost 1 inch blank border.)... means if you buy any publisher book you will get same print so go for lesser price than this but make sure its publisher is well known.

This publication uses a tiny font and minimal spacing that makes your book reading experience quite horrible. Reading this books for five minutes result in eye fatigue. It is better to read e-books than to read a book published by this publication house.

The Subtle Art,Hetansh Doshi,A book with really great topics but slightly underdelivered,5,"Here's everything about my experience from the first to the last page....and yes there are some cons What should be your purpose to read this book? If you think this a self help book that will help you learn how to not give a F*ck about things, be ready for some twists. This book is more about how to know what to give a F*ck about. The autor has done a great job of pointing out your obvious but unrecognised mistakes you make everyday. Now although the book is great and well spoken of, we all know that no book ever is perfect... 1) Sounds silly but the initial chapters of the book will make this book feel like a joke. Not because of the content delivered, but the amount of times the writer uses the word F*ck to make it 'so called' funny and engaging. I literary googled how many times he used the word. 2) The books delivers the content it's titled up to 6-7 chapters after which it feels like he unnecessarily talked about relationship stuff and his life as he lived possibly to make it a 200 page book. Being a cover to cover reader, I just felt like one shouldn't waste time reading the last two chapters. Here's my final score : Condition of book : 10/10 (Matte finish) Readability : 9/10 (Won't feel bored) Valuable content : 7/10 (Personal opinion) Practicality : 8/10 Use of the word F*ck : 100/10 Would recommend reading : Yes Happy reading :)"
The Subtle Art,Ajinkya K.,I know it's a little late but....it's important.,5,"I'll be honest, I ordered the book on 10th October 2022 and I only started reading this book on 26th June 2024. I initially ordered the book on a casual basis I kinda wanted to change but I lacked the conviction so I just read one or two pages and stopped (Boy was I sooo wrong). The past few months have been rough, things haven't been pleasant (due to my own doings). Lowkey felt depressed but this time I've decided to change for good (I'm still improving and I've made some changes which I hope work out in the long term). All that aside (The backstory was needed because it was relevant to the change the book is and will bring about me) let's talk about the book now, Firstly I can't emphasize how good and engaging this book is, Mark is an excellent author and has a keen eye for people (and their behaviours). The book feels more like reading a novel instead of a self help book (in case you feel they're too mundane and boring), filled with a lot of relevant examples to the topic being discussed. This book was a mirror to my inner self it confronted me with things about myself I didn't know, as well as things I always knew but chose to ignore and neglect. It makes you ponder your choices, your behaviours everything that makes you ''You'. The initial chapters of the book were depressing me more than motivating me but as I read through more chapters and changed a few of my habits, I realized that the reason for not liking the earlier chapters were because they highlighted and brought out the bad values in front of me. Something I don't think I would've even thought about doing or changing. It's teaching me how to tackle my own problems and the past few days have genuinely felt good. I know it's kind of a long review but I can't stress enough how a good of a book this is doesn't matter whether you are old, young, successful or not or whatever stage of life you're in, this book will most Definitely help you. After I complete this I'm definitely willing to buy other books from Mark."
The Subtle Art,Sambhav Kumar,ONE OF THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ.,5,"This book gave me a complete new direction in the way of thinking breaking the previous formed notions in my mind. And after finishing this book I found myself revived and rejuvenated which is everlasting forever. You can go through this book without giving any doubt. This book resembles with another book written by Shamitabh- THE RUDEST BOOK EVER., That also holds similar power to drive such unique perceptions into one's life. Hope the readers find this helpful."
The Subtle Art,Rahul Adarsh Ekka,Amazing read,5,"I just started reading books and Im glad this was the book I started my reading journey with, it was really worth reading this book and would recommend this book to everyone."

The Subtle Art,Indranil,Epic,5,One of the best books out there which delivers ideas in a simple and plain way as if the author is talking to you . Basically a self help comic book .
The Subtle Art,Hansh Raj,A bit irritating at first but diamonds in every word.,5,I started reading this a month ago...and it seemed so annoying at first due to the repeated use of the word F*ck. But slowly got used to it and after about 20 or 30 pages it all suddenly started to make sense.
The Subtle Art,Surbhi Kumari,Awesome,5,What a book!!! And why didn't I read it earlier.. worth it
The Subtle Art,JITENDRA RAMESH PATIL,Learning with Confidence,5,Reading with Consistency
The Subtle Art,Vish,Necessity,5,We dont get to hear this POV in social media. This definitely lightens the load and changes the perspective. Must read!
The Subtle Art,PRASHANTH,Awesome..,5,"The book increases your maturity , and also your personality.. Go for it.."
The Subtle Art,Sulaiman,Book on your thoughts and priorities,5,"Makes you think of your priorities.. cause nothing is priority... Everything is just an illusion your thoughts, actions everything.. It's like 'once a man was wondering what are the symptoms of death.... He met many scholars and wise people to get some clue... Nothing intrested him... Then One day he met an old man, with his look he was wise enough with a long beard, and he asked the same question to him 'Do you know what are the symptoms of death.?' The man paused for a moment and said 'Yes i believe I do cause whenever came accross a dead man, if I look back whether he had this symptom, he does...! The man was shocked. Whats is that? he asked, the wise man replied, 'The birth!'. And the books gives the context of this story."
The Subtle Art,Md Yasar Khan,Life Changing,5,Loved it.
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,Liberating experience,5,I am extremely in love with this book. Felt it is genuine and reflection of life. Read this book while going through a very bad phase of life and this book alleviates me. I already plans to gift this book to some of my frnds. One guy who had a bad childhood because of his rude parents and still suffers from insecurities. Other to a girl who is my frnd and also my best friends girlfriend. This is because both me and my best friend thinks that their relationship would be much better if she realises some things. And this book exactly mentions these things in last parts. And many others. This is not the usual self help crap. This is confrontation with reality of life and turning things around for a happy life.
The Subtle Art,sanal,This is the best looking book I ever bought.,5,The book is very well designed in terms of aesthetics. I haven't read the book at the time of writing but I 100% believe it is a great read.
The Subtle Art,Nikhil Saini,Enlightening!!,5,Amazing work by Mark. This book really helped me to understand some basic life points that get usually ignored. Keep it up mark.
The Subtle Art,Shubham Kakkar,Great read,5,"Truly a privilege to be put on this pedestal with zero credibility, reviewing this international best seller. Its an international best seller for a reason and youll know it only if you read it!"
The Subtle Art,Good Keyboard Go for it,Knowledgable,5,Good book you must have to read
The Subtle Art,Sunita,Nice book,5,Good book must buy
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,Amazing,5,"I haven't read many books mainly because I felt content being presented in video/audio format is far more engaging than text format. But I could feel my attention span decreasing over the years... so I decided to read this one (mainly because the title seemed interesting). Now that I've finished the book I can say that this book is helpful, not in a uplifting motivational kind of way, but in an other way (mark refers to this as 'the backward law')."
The Subtle Art,Amru,Nice,5,Nice
The Subtle Art,Ashok Kumar Sharma,Refined stuff in bold words!!!,5,"I like it for its casual style of diagnosing and curing the most common life style difficulties that need rare but effective treatment. I recommend this book to working class, aspirants of wishful jobs and guys who want to live life - their own. I thank the writer to make the extract of bitter books in shape of cold coffee without any f*ck."
The Subtle Art,Disha,Buy it!,5,"Worth reading, I haven't yet finished it as I am taking the chapters slowly and implementing it at the same time, so it's taking time to complete, quality self help book with quotes to live by... Lessons taught with stories of both successful and failed people, this was what I liked the most about this book."
The Subtle Art,Adithi,A must read,5,This book is a must read for everyone who wants to build a better version of oneself but are stuck its one amazing book especially for people pleasers(like me)
The Subtle Art,ssp,A life book,5,"This can be a life changing book , please try. The best is lesson maybe that I should remember that death is inevitable and all my thoughts and actions can be reformed , amended by that constant reminder to self"
The Subtle Art,Vallabha Sayar,Definitely a must have in your shelf,5,"A book that starts out with potty mouthed language to keep the readers hooked and then goes onto making re'Mark'able arguments about various aspects such as life being an endless barrage of struggles and rejection and failure is the only way forward and essential to build character and refine one's values around leading a fulfilling life. He drops a few ques from various psycological studies to support his argument albeit he doesn't mention the source of the research (like a paper or link in a bibliography section or something). This book can get incredibly difficult to read at places in which case it's doing its intended job. Through this book I see Mark's own journey, views and learning recited authentically, sometimes without filters too. On the constant path to living a good life ? This can give you a headstart. Definitely one of my favourite books to read in your 20s."
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Amazingly written Book,5,"It's a clear life changer book, Focuses on making us a better person... Loved it and I am gonna read it again over the years, what an amazing experience it was reading this!"
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Gud,5,Nice product
The Subtle Art,jeevan a.,Good book and good service,5,"I had a great delivery experience(book 'delivery'), The book i received was in perfect condition. Fonts are super readable, paper quality is good. I won't consider this book a serious self improvement guide and a 'self improvement bible' but it's a good book and you will have a good reading experience. GO for it &lt;3"
The Subtle Art,Subhodeep Das,Best thing i have read in a long time,5,The writer points it out in black and white terms not to overthink about stuff that we have no control over. Sometimes we are stuck in a bad situation and that's how life is. Not everything needs to be perfect.
The Subtle Art,Nafisa,An eye-opening read,5,"There's nothing absolutely new presented to you in this book and it's definitely not some kind of a revelation - but the way facts we are already familiar with (but refuse to accept) and simple situations we all regularly experience have been referenced and worded, make this book a wake-up call for all of us who whine and crib, compare ourselves with others, and set unrealistic goals for ourselves, all leading to our perpetual frustration. This is the story of all of our lives, and the book presents before us very straightforward and to-the-point approaches for tackling our daily woes - things each of us must hear sooner or later. This is not a self-help guide to life with mantras or lists of affirmations to recite to ourselves every morning. It tells us that it's absolutely normal, okay, and in fact important, to be insecure and face problems and feel frustrated, but there is always a way to change our approach and view problems as opportunities/challenges, not permanent blocks. It changes your perspective on how you view yourself, deal with your insecurities, deal with difficult situations involving others, and how you control your temper and learn to let go of minor issues as well as deal with and move on from major inconveniences. It's definitely relatable, worth your time, and a must-read!"
The Subtle Art,Vivek Raghuram,The subtle art of looking past oneself,5,"If youre looking for a book that explains why you need to accept responsibility for yourself, this is the one. Its a relatively short read and engages the reader through anecdotes from the authors life and of some well-known people. Unlike a lot of self- help books that focus on boosting your ego, this one focuses on looking past that ego at the greater picture of life and how you play your part in it."
The Subtle Art,Vivek Antonio,"Truths, in your face!",5,"I've read a lot of 'self help' books, and this fits into that category albeit with a different but effective style. Mark writesbhome some hard truths and asks some tough questions here. Expect to do some hard thinking when and after you finish reading this!"
The Subtle Art,Trinjan dutta,Good read,5,Catchy contexts
The Subtle Art,Jyoti Mehra,Excellent,5,Very practical book
The Subtle Art,Nitika,Must read!!,5,"Even if this book teaches you one point that hits you hard and brings about the required result, then , it has done its job well enough and this is what happened in my case!! Highly recommend this book!!"
The Subtle Art,Koushal Pant,Helps you to look at life froma different perspective.,5,"I think this book is a best for everyone above the age of 13 particularly, Teenagers. It really feels like seeing the reality of the whole world in 200 pages. I love the humourous and story-telling-type writing of Mark Manson. He really describes some good and appropriate points in the book like feeling guilty of feeling guilty. 'The feedback loop from hell' is what he calls it. It was worth it to read the book and learn from author's real life experiences too. I received the book in a good condition. It's new. The pages are fresh and the print is clear. Delivery was before the given time and pretty fast. If you're uncertain of buying it. I would say go for it! It's worth it!"
The Subtle Art,Tushar M.,Honest,5,"No suggestions for to do this or that, just some honest life facts that we need to reflect from this book. This book is so much more than what the title says. I love Mr. Manson for his awkward sincerity and his dark humour. I felt no part boring to read. It was one hell of a ride"
The Subtle Art,Badal Harit,A new and well packed book,5,"Just bought it, the book is in new condition and packed correctly. Gonna update the rating after book completion. Update after finishing the book:- It is must read book, even if it is your first book that you are reading. Don't go for negative reviews, they aren't even finishing any single chapter before criticizing the word repetition. It makes my brain calm and might help you as well."
The Subtle Art,santosh,A must read in your 20's,5,"Mainly focuses on what you should bother and what not to be concerned, describes how one's own values arre important in their life. Although some part of the book seems uninteresting, overall it's a good read."
The Subtle Art,Resh,Very interesting book,5,Very interesting book
The Subtle Art,Ankush,Good night dear friend,5,looking like a wow nice
The Subtle Art,Syed Talha Mian,best values,5,"the books tells you really what you need to know in order to be happy in your life, I censored the f word on the cover of this book because I have conservative parents who don't understand that never judge a book by it's cover. I recommend this book to all the age groups ."
The Subtle Art,Kedar patil,Best self help book for beginners nd depression ;),5,"The book uses the hard truth to convey it's massage in several of the topics being discussed. Being a self-help book, it may sound boring, but the book has stories that makes it perfect for fiction or story book readers.While the book uses vulgur language, it is kept to a bare minimum, according to our expectations for it due to the catchy title.The best way to read this book is going from sub-chapters to sub-chapters and taking a small break to grsp it's massage.This will exceed your expectations only if you take it for a vulgur slang book or having less knowledge than a normal book.Good for teenagers going to 20 and anyone who feels depressed."
The Subtle Art,Jacob,A must read book for self help,5,"This book is a must read for those of you who are seeking self-help to solve the problems in your life. Unlike other books, there's no fillers in this to fill the space. The author is always on point. I can already see a few changes in me, good changes, after I had started reading this book. Thank you Mark for writing a wonderful book."

The Subtle Art,Atanu Ghosh,Best hardcover book,5," The media could not be loaded. The purchase was great, it was super quick and the quality is awesome. I loved the book."
The Subtle Art,Aakarsh J.,A good read,5,"It is Splendid and funny, No doubt why this is a best best seller. Kudos! To the author.The book teaches you something which is really needed nowadays .Dont know why its 3.9/5 on goodreads. Deserves 4.78/5 or just 5/5 at least. A lot of fs &amp; No fs were given anyway "
The Subtle Art,Faheem Mohammed,This book has given my life a new purpose!,5,"I had long delayed reading this book because I never made time for it. I believed I was busy, but in all honesty, I was just slacking my days off with my depression. Now that I finished reading this, I think I have found a new purpose in life and I'm going to start reading a lot more books to make the most out of my life. This book, in a way, has shown me what's important to me and what's not."
The Subtle Art,Romin K. Irani,Great book! Gives you lessons to lead your life,5,"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The author breaks down what is important in life by building it up throughout the book. Don't worry about the language at times, though I feel that it is perfectly fine because we all need a kick up our rear to understand things. The highlight of the book is a framework you get for leading your life in a more meaningful way, that is bound to have an effect not just on you but also those around you. In the end we all have to confront death and hence working on something that is greater than ourselves with being mindful of our own mortality , leads to a more meaningful life and that is what the book tells you about. I strongly suggest that you read the book once, ask yourself the questions and take it from there."
The Subtle Art,Chris john,Read about the potato.,5,"It was so dam good i didn't expect what it was until i read the book but omg I've never thought it too be that deep in every aspect and yea it helps on how to live but not everyone likes being told that you're doing it. Wrong but damn the humour was on the edge and creepy just the potato ones are good. This book was so good to read and i realized something's , i didn't know about the author too i just thought it was badass to have a title like that on the book damn mark you had it! Snickers nope ok . i recommend to read it."
The Subtle Art,sawati sharma,Great book,5,"This is surely the bestest book I have grabbed till date. Everything is so precise and to the point. As if Mark knows what was needed and gave exactly the same. The language might not seem suitable for some but that won't bother because in the later chapters, it does not prevail. The matter is presented in crisp and clear words. The book is not bulky and language is clear even for the Indian audience. Grab a copy soon, read it twice or thrice or as many times as you would like and see yourself changing every day that too for all the good reasons. I liked the book more because it is like Mark is talking directly to me and every word and sentence is so relatable. Highly recommended"
The Subtle Art,Anne,Really very good,5,"I brought this book a while ago because frankly I thought it sounded really cool. After two weeks in quarantine, when I started to read it, I was dissapointed. There's a boatload of the cusswords used unnecessarily (although I should have seen that coming). So if you are turned off by that, I think it may seem unsuitable for you. After about a month, I tried to read it again, and it was much better. The book talks about how you view problems and I could relate to a lot of issues that were talked about. Really changed my outlook towards any problem that I face."
The Subtle Art,N,It's the most amazing book I could think of,5,"It's the most amazing book I could think of, definitely worth a read. It should be read after other self help books because of its counterintuitive nature and so that it can have a better impact because the other books talk about delusionary concepts commonly which this book breaks. The first chapter of 'The Power of your Subconscious Mind' made me drop it in an instant because of the wrong concept it focuses on after reading this book. Making a person believe in his own dominant lies will only put him in a paradox of delusional happiness is what I think. However, how a person interprets this book can vary greatly because it's rather subtle and extremely difficult to control and change your thoughts at every moment of life and learn how to do it for every little thing."
The Subtle Art,Rahul,"When fear of death vanishes, fear of failure has no space to exist.",5,It's not a book but an everlasting friend. Practical &amp; Real. I Read it completely. I would recommend you to read it before you die. Am Not a kind of person who gives reviews but still it's a great book to pick. Thanks to 'Mark Manson' to add some values to my life. Amazon service: 5 stars
The Subtle Art,Vaibhav Padwal,Extra ordinary... view towards life,5,The Authors view towards life is extra ordinary. people struggle whole of their lives chasing their materialistic highs and end up losing their the actual treasure/ happiness. Thumps up to the Author for straight forward bold language and presentation.
The Subtle Art,Shubham,Good,5,"About the quality of the book received: The book delivered was in good condition, no wear/tear, no missing pages, etcetera. About the contents of this book: The author has done a good job in achieving what he initially states is the content of the book. He has also taken into consideration certain situations where the words used could be very easily misunderstood, and has clarified them crystal clear(this part I loved the most about this book). Overall, its a good read. I, personally, loved it!"
The Subtle Art,SHREESHA Y N,Best Life Guide to have !!!,5,"I really loved this book. Because it's very straight forward. I loved the writing style of the author. I got many perspectives on how to view our lives and also got practical solutions to many life problems , confusions. I really recommend everyone to read this book...... Because this book is a LIFE GUIDE !!! Looking forward to read the 2nd book !!!"
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,Counterintuitive Approach,5,I like the insights and wisdom which this book carry and love the writing style of mark manson amazing book
The Subtle Art,Sharath c.,Worthwhile read.,5,"Finished reading this amazing book. After reading many reviews I thought this book would bolster up our confidence. Indeed, this book will help you learn how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively and deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own and also it would stimulate us to be more resilient In order to confront difficulties in life and alleviate our inferiorities."
The Subtle Art,manal.shaikh,Eye-opening,5,"Beautiful book. Has so many insights on life , am eye-opener. I would recommend this book to actually everyone who want have better understanding of what is actually going on in our lives, to get this beautiful perspective on life."
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,Mind-Blowing,5,"I don't think I have absorbed even 5 percent of this book in the first reading. It will probably require much more than just a single read to actually implement all the mind opening things this book talks about. I feel every person on Earth should read this book, especially the chapter on death. I don't want to talk about the actual book in this brief review as it won't do justice to it. But it's not just another self-help book. Its way too different and talks about things which everyone avoids all the time. Highly recommended."
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Teaching lifes simplicity in simple words.,5,"Humans fail to learn the simple truth. Its not always about us. This is yet another attempt to spread that message, and creates its own ripple."
The Subtle Art,Ramit,Good to read for mental stability,5,Good to read for mental stability of every individual. I liked this book from core of my heart Thank you
The Subtle Art,Paulomi,One of the best book,5,If you want to develop your character and stay chilled it's a must read. I think everyone read this once in their life atleast.
The Subtle Art,Vishnuwardhan Srikanth,"If you're buying one self-improvement book, it should be this!",5,"Every sentence in this book is pure distilled wisdom from a person who has been through the ups and downs of life. In this book, Mark Manson breaks down exactly why we feel dissatisfied, what the root cause(s) is/are, and how to reorient ourselves to experience happiness in everyday activities. He avoids the focus on full-time positivity that causes more problems than it solves, and provides a more realistic, albeit much harder approach of identifying the underlying values that shape your thoughts and modifying them. I think every person on the planet should read this book for a fresh new perspective on life."
The Subtle Art,Chiranjib,A Book Unlike any Major Self Improvement Books,5,"1. Quality of book 5* (Unlike some negative reviews regarding quality, I found the book to be of the best quality. Pages were crisp without any tears or misprints) 2. Value for money 5* ( Got it for some 200+ INR. Crossword bookstore was selling it at 400+ INR range) 3. Content 5* (Though went through only 40% of the book, the content is direct as hell. The way Mansion describes the fallacies of modern self improvement gurus is stellar. Enough of books dictating how you should live your life. Time to accept our negatives and accomplish major goals piggy riding on them. Can't wait to finish this book)"
The Subtle Art,Shivangi,Subtle Motivation,5,"Must Read. Will make you look at your life from a different perspective, its not like the regular coming of the age stories where everything will fall into place, it asks some difficult but critical questions that we all should ponder upon to make our lives better than yesterday."
The Subtle Art,Pranjal,A shock to my being,5,"This book was certainly not what i expected it to be. I had to pause and reflect everytime mark offered something contradictory to my beliefs. I didnt agree with everything he had to say but most of it made sense. i think of myself as a logical person and i questioned myself a lot that how did i not realise this by myself or sooner. after reading the book i feel like the clutter in my mind has been cleared, the pressure has been released and i can pursue my life goals with a clarity i had never experienced. its all simple really, its just not easy."
The Subtle Art,susant nandi,A must read,5,After this fantastic read someone will definitely become more responsible for his/her own problems and will focus on things truly important to him/her.
The Subtle Art,Amanjot Kaur,Changed my life,5,"Frankly speaking i was an introvert and always given a damn to everything happened to me or around me. This book is a masterpiece and taught me a lot of thing. About life,world,people,love,Friendship and many more. Given me the hope to have a hope and when you have hope you will always look forward to a new day. Changed my life and views, now i am on the process of living my own life on my own terms. Try not to care what people blabbers about me. Amazing book go for it. My first self help book."
The Subtle Art,Tejas Rajput,Best book you will read this week,5,"This ia the best book you can read. It helps you understand the value of accepting the truth and work toward resolving the problems in a right way rather than avoiding them trying to feel positive all the time. It make you understand the value of problems, negative feelings and accepting them(rather than trying to feel positive) will be the better option. The problems are to move you and to make you a better person. Also it teaches you that you don't need to be right all the time. You never will be. You will just be slightly less wrong than before. Its truly a readers delight. I hope you like it."
The Subtle Art,yash b.,Amazing read,5,"This is a very interesting book, a must read if you struggling in your life and want to change your self, there are some eye-opener topics which will be very helpful in life."
The Subtle Art,Kusuma Ghattu,Fantastic book,5,"This book changes our view towards life, it's a counter to all the self help books in the market which blabber about positive thinking and other stuff that may leave us in temporary highness and will surely be our biggest mistake in the long run, it's like a tight slap from our inner self to do the best to ourselves in day today life by facing problems and not running away, author though using cusswords makes his point straight as if someone is looking into the eye and telling you what's the best thing for you to do now, fantastic book, changed my perspective about everything"
The Subtle Art,Divyansh,"If you love brutal honesty, you'll love this book too.",5,"Liking or disliking a book is a very subjective matter. There are no black or white areas. You will have to read it know for sure if you love it or not. Would I recommend this book? Without doubt. Even if you disagree with what the author has to say, it'll definitely challenge your perspective and your astute opinions on important matters in life. If you love brutal honesty, you'll love this book too."
The Subtle Art,NAIDU SANAPALA,Very Practical Advice Book. I give 100/100,5,This book helps us to get a practical understanding of our life's issues. It's a great book to read for everyone. I give 100/100
The Subtle Art,Ronit S.,A must read for overthinkers.,5,"The best thing about this book is that it's brutal honest. Well u can have debates on some topics mentioned but by far it's my favourite book and the most self realizing , especially the last chapter. Great work of art, must read."
The Subtle Art,"Amazing product in this price , you can buy it. It's so good ",Amazing product,5,You guys should read this... It's really very good.

The Subtle Art,Shashank,Must read for Everyone!! ONE OF IT'S KIND,5,"Great Read! At first absorbing the contents of the book for me was a little difficult but after some time and a few pages i was understanding the true meaning of this book. This book literally changed my view of actually viewing the world around me, I won't spoil for you but i can guarantee that if you open it with an open mind it will help you change yours too!"
The Subtle Art,Prudhvi,Bitter truth,5,"1) Do you want to understand the reality of life ? 2) Do you want the ability to handle situations in life with maturity? If at least any one of above is true, then go for this book. This book will prepare you to face problems in life with at most maturity. Take this bitter pill and enjoy solving problems in life."

The Subtle Art,Placeholder,helped me understand my flaws,5,I had misunderstood many spiritual concepts and had developed a weird anti social lifestyle. This book cleared a lot of my concepts and made my understanding aligned with the practical world.
The Subtle Art,SOUMITRA PATHAK,Bought for my Gf,5,"I give this product to my gf , coz she was so depressed after reading this book , now she is a doctor and she having a cute child , her husband is now pilot! And i have tea shop now! End story"
The Subtle Art,Sravankumar,Changes way you approach things,5,"This book changed the way I think. Being positive everytime gets us into trouble. The feeling good type thing always feels good for a reason. It makes you stagnant. Feeling of great, high feeling literally dumps you which I experienced in my college days. As humans we are flawed by nature. So, we should always cross-check what we are doing rather than feeling right all the time. Our mind cheats us many times."
The Subtle Art,Richa,"Practical,Realistic &Well Written",5,"First of all do not judge the book by its title. I was also not sure to buy it but its supernice reviews force me to do so . And Thank God,I did.Its one of the most practical self help book I came across.No goody goody positive pictures but a blunt and relevant stuff is given. Thd author emphasises on accepting ourselves the way we are and taking responsibility of our problems..no blame game..no illusions but truth.... The chapters are welll written except the cuss word usage but after reading the book one will understand the title well..The book is different and very impressive.So please do not wait but buy..."
The Subtle Art,Atul Kumar Singh,"Unconventional Wisdom, you'd love reading it",4,"This is one book that would definitely catch your eye, owing to its bright orange cover and a title thats so unconventional! Kudos to Mark Manson for this! I don't think I'd have picked this up otherwise. Okay. First things first, whether you like the book or not, whether you take anything substantial away from this book or not, whether you implement any wisdom described in the book in your life or not, I think you would definitely enjoy the way this book is written, its language and the general fun feeling of reading through a book, which I would safely put in the genre of Unconventional Wisdom. I loved reading this book! I think its very relatable, the way the author has described various instances and examples. However, implementing the same attitude in your life might be tricky and difficult. If you can implement it the way the author intends to, I think you would be on your path to a successful life. I think this book is especially useful for people who keep worrying about trivial things way too much. The book will teach you to focus on larger things and dont care about petty stuff that has no meaning or effect on your life. The book will also teach you to embrace mediocrity because admit it, not everyone is going to be great. But it also teaches you that such acceptance is the first step towards achieving something better, if not something great. However, I think the books target audience is the younger generation, young adults. The book will make you realize some things which you already know but you couldnt admit to yourself. Some parts would be extremely funny, just because of the way certain things are described and put together in the book. Some other parts would be really enlightening. Also, there would be times when the author reminisces about his past, which can get slightly boring and dragging, even exaggerated. Some of my favorite quotes from the book: - People who become great at something become great because they understand that theyre not already great - they are mediocre, they are average - and that they could be so much better. - You always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. - If youre stuck on a problem, dont sit there and think about it, just start working on it. Even if you dont know what youre doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head. - You too are going to die, and thats because you too were fortunate enough to have lived. - Pain, in all of its forms, is our bodys most effective means of spurring action. - Not giving a f does not mean being indifferent, it means being comfortable with being different. To conclude, I would recommend this one to my fellow readers (or non-readers). Cheers!"
The Subtle Art,AJAY KALHIA,Not bad,4,This book ain't that bad. It's good. Go for it. I liked it. But ppl interested in psychology stuff should go for smth better but still it's fine.
The Subtle Art,Rocky Balboa,What...,4,Orginal book.
The Subtle Art,Mohit Hada,Lovely,4,Fullllll of hatred
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,a modern practical approach towards life,4,"I read this book over a period of three months, when i was fighting my own demons and looking for answers somewhere. When you will be hitting the mid life crisis stage at 29, you introspect yourself and ask what have i achieved or am i doing things right. Thats when, i wanted to distract my self and know about life more and this book arrived in the Goodreads review section among the best modern self help book. Though you cannot absorb the book in one go, but there were three lessons that i took from this book. 1. The feeling of entitlement, that you are special, that is why it is happening to you or why not me i am special. Every body in life goes through similar struggles, failures, pains and hardship. So stop feeing so entitled that why it is happening to me. 2. In the beginning of the book, author gives the example of drunk, bad mouthed person who later becomes a well known famous poet and author. In this i learned that people who work hard arent always successful. Sometimes you just have to let life happen, stop planning for that beautiful future you desire,just keep on working and universe will make ways to get things to you. 3. Death is inevitable and the earlier you know, the better you will savour the present moment and lose shackles of entitlement, jealousy and ego. Thank you. Ps :- this is my very first review in amazon. I have read books but never ever reviewed it."
The Subtle Art,Divya,nice,4,"nice book , one should read ds who overthinks a lot"
The Subtle Art,Diksha Suman (@beingsheblog),This book is Reality :),4,"My Rating: 4.8/5 Reading this book was fun. It was exactly like a tight refreshing slap on my face to awake me to see the reality. It has real and deep talks plus not to make us feel bored, it has humour and entertaining stories into it. (Thats the best part of this book, I guess the writer is very good at humour) The first page itself says, dont try and I was like everyone around us just say one thing to motivate us try, try, try, try harder, were they wrong or the writer is wrong? but then the writer again gives a valid reason with examples and he proved all of us wrong This book has been divided into 9 Chapters, starting with Dont try to And then you die. In between are Happiness is a problem, You are not special, The value of suffering, You are always choosing, You are wrong about everything (But so am I), Failure is the way forward, The importance of saying no. Reading these headlines itself would have made you imagine that book is pretty awesome and different from all others self-help books which you would have read before. I personally loved the last part of the book, And then you die. Because it made me think about my present strongly. One of the line in the book says, You dont need to be positive all the time and this shocked me because I have never thought this way but the writer has valid reasons for this too. And I agree with it. Turning each page of the book was like reading something which I have never even thought of. This book clearly says that No one is perfect, we have our own limitations, fears, faults, uncertainties. Accepting it with full faith will make us live a better and a fruitful life. What are we doing is just the opposite, we are running away from this painful truth, comforting our self with self-made lies, ignoring it just to feel that we are normal but we are not. Tackling all this will make us normal until then we all are abnormal, living as if we are dead. We will have to accept it and soon we will be enough courageous to face this and live with Confidence."
The Subtle Art,Dhananjaya J N,Nice,4,Good book. Experience shared richly here. Author has lived great life and just words are connected. Good for personality development.
The Subtle Art,Subin Khullar,Amazing take on life,4,"This is one of the best books I have read in a while. It contains some interesting psychological theories related to life and how to deal with problems, what to focus on and what to let go, and how focusing on the few core values can help is in making good decisions. A must read! "
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Old wine in a new bottle :),4,"I'm gonna start by saying that this book is not exactly how we interpret its title. Majority of us think that it teaches us not to care. But, It doesn't. It teaches us to care, really care, but only for the important things. The book starts really well. The reader feels at ease from the very beginning. And pretty soon it feels like this book is against the methodology taught us by 'The Secret' and 'How to stop worrying and start living'. I kinda hated that part because I love those books. But then as you move forward, you realize that it's not really against them. It just breaks the upper layer first so that it can teach you what's really inside that methodology later. Some would say it's just an old wine in a new bottle ... and I wouldn't comment on that ;) You gotta find it yourself because it's a matter of perception. Myth: It's the title. The first thing comes into our mind is that this book will teach us how to live a carefree life. Although in reality, it teaches us are we caring enough for the things that matter to us? So get your expectations clear before you start it. More Positives: The Writer shares some really great stories (really great) of people which makes you question whether you're measuring your life on the right metrics or not. So if you want to have a closer view of life - a must read. Personal advice: If you've already read 'The Secret' &amp; 'How to stop worrying and start living' and you're 100% clear about the lessons those books taught you and you also apply them in your life, you can skip this book. But if you haven't read those books yet or you didn't understand them properly or are not applying in your life - It's a must-read for you people!"
The Subtle Art,Vishwajeet Gudale,Perfect Book,4,Best Book... Pointed very Simple points which we didn't even know !
The Subtle Art,rajivbhatia,good to read,4,"Feeling of satisfaction emerges while reading, topics chosen are good, it makes you think twice what you are doing with you life? You are really living or you are spending your life in trivial subjects."
The Subtle Art,Sanskriti Kwatra,Go for it!!,4,"This book will help u a lot in life, this book has the potential to change your way of thinking. And one of the best books I have ever read. Strongly Recommend"
The Subtle Art,George,Says it like it is,4,This is not a motivational book. This helps you evaluate yourself and create a better perception of yourself with relation to others and enjoy life more. If 'how to win friends' was a fantasy novel this book is a more practical guide to life.
The Subtle Art,Vasu Chourasia,Book review,4,The media could not be loaded. The cover page and the quality of the book pages is really good... Overall it's good value for. Money... Thank you amazon
The Subtle Art,Vaibhav,"Liked the analogy, may provide you quick solutions",4,"Readers may not find it that counterintuitive. Some may find it easy said than done. Liked the analogy, may provide you quick solutions"
The Subtle Art,Belliappa,Recived in good shape,4,Cannot say whats in it and writing but the book came in nice package no dammage
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,The approach to Life,4,Nicely presented
The Subtle Art,kazi momtajul Kabir,Must read!!!,4,These advices doesn't suck at all.
The Subtle Art,Linny Jacob,A different perspective,4,"Every individual thinks, feels and behaves in a unique way. Some say this book is overrated but I felt it's just how it was supposed to be and helped me see things in a different light. It's not always necessary to fill a book with variety of vocabulary but what matters is whether or not you understood the content and does it make sense? Yes it does.. it definitely did to me mainly because I could associate it to my life experiences and also of a few others that I know personally. Even though there are no research or evidence based studies in it I felt that it was deeply connected to psychology. As a psychology majored person, it made sense to me in many ways. So dont just mock an author or their book. It depends on a individual's perspective."
The Subtle Art,Paramita M.,Recommended for early 20's,4,It's a really nice book. It will catch your attention definitely like it's tittle.
The Subtle Art,kopal singhal,"Apt, blunt and plain truth",4,One of the best books i have ever read. It takes you through daily struggles and situations where you want to excel to prove your worth and guides whats best to do. The book may be a game changer for some. Happy reading!!!
The Subtle Art,Binit,Different prospective to life,4,"I heard a lot about this book but never got a chance to read it coz of my hectic schedule. Thanks to the lock down I order and read it. The idea of this can be spectical to some, but I personally like it as it gives a different angle to think of life. Don't give too many f***s!!!There are instances where the writer says don't try as once you achieve anything you will not feel any good as you will have something else to achieve agian, but on the other half he says to be happy you need problem and solving them will make you happy. But how on earth will I solve them if I don't try, confused me too "
The Subtle Art,Kitch,Nice Book,4,"I liked the book. Engaging and descriptive. It is kind of informal and loved the way it is written. The book mainly discusses what we need to hear than what we want to hear. I'd give an overall 4.8/5. Thanks, Mark Manson, the book DID make some difference!"
The Subtle Art,Archana L,Unexpectedly deep and refreshing,4,"I'm not usually the type to pick a book that has a swear word in its title, but I'm glad I read this one. Mark Manson, in all his cussing glory packages lessons from the stoics, the life experiences of remarkable individuals in history and embeds his own personal journey, all without ever coming across as preachy. He doesn't sugarcoat the messages as self help books sometimes tend to do, instead, he writes in a voice that's as irreverent as it is vulnerable. He leads you down so many different paths of thinking while admitting he doesn't have it all figured out yet. This book holds your attention from start to finish and some passages even make you stop and let the insight sink in before you read further. Go ahead and read it, you won't be disappointed."
The Subtle Art,Placeholder,Must Read!,4,"This is one wake up call of a book. And I think more people ought to read it. It teaches you what most self help books miss, that it's okay for life to suck sometimes. It's okay to fail. It teaches you that suffering and pain and problems are a crucial part of life. And that solving the problems that life throws at you are the only way to achieve true happiness. It teaches you that the amount of Fs (read : the f-word) that you can give in your life time is limited. That's why you shouldn't go around wasting your Fs on unnecessary things. You don't have to care about everything. Care only about the important things in life and this will bring you happiness. For more, go and read the book. It's a must read."
The Subtle Art,Lavi,Need to re read it,4,"Complications around us explained in a very simple manner with loads of real life examples of how to implement the authors suggestion. But honestly felt he is too much into himself. As he mentioned about his hook ups and access to girls whenever he wished for and then mentions he also had to lose weight later on and stuff, somewhere I felt he cooked up things to make it more appealing. Well those are trivial things but the messages conveyed are quite impactful, I would say its more On the language part I got drawn for, like English was the language of poor while Latin was used by elites. The language used here though is English but the one we converse usually :) so personally I felt as if Im hearing from a friend."
The Subtle Art,Rohan Savio Fernandes,"A good read, but....",4,"While the book is a good read, it definitely has some cons. For example, it lacks clarity on few topics, and it seems that the writer has used the word 'f*ck' a lot, only because the book is titled 'Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck."
The Subtle Art,sarthak sengupta,Fitting substance backing the impressive name,4,"Self help books are having some mandatory conditions to become timeless. Keeping the pace, avoiding the repeatation, giving some line which will echo even after one year of reading, and being honest. Jim Kwik's book was the first one which achieved all these, among the books I read. Mark Manson, also somewhat achieved those."
The Subtle Art,Tarunxp,"I purchased it for 325, later saw it goes down to 275.",4," The media could not be loaded. I purchased it for 325, later saw it goes down to 275. So before purchasing wait and check the pricing continuously. Don't purchase above 300. Now lets talk about the book, i always afraid from pirated books so check very carefully, its Genuine copy as far as i checked. But there's a little fading on the book's orange colour, and little scratch on the side. These are my first impressions, Otherwise this is indeed a awesome book. I'll update my review after reading the book. Remember, Go for this book below 300."
The Subtle Art,Placeholder,The biggest take away from this book is is don't care about everything in life only give f*** to those things that are important and also a thing about questioning yourself about death again and again which will make you ultimately realise how short life is and you are wasting it so much,4,It's a good book it tells you about many things which you can do in life as your life is very short and if you keep on giving so many f**** in life it will be over if you are fond of learning some values in form of stories you can refer to this book but if you are like me and not a big fan of stories and only want to gain some knowledge then maybe this book is not for you
The Subtle Art,Ranjith,the counter intuitive approach indeed.,4,"When started reading the book, I was little skeptical about reading it and the coarse language used did not look pleasing. But as I started diving into its content chapter after chapter, it started inducing a strange perspective of the problems in our lives and the way author expressed his views in a counter-intuitive way makes it different from other self help books. The real world illustrations helps readers experience problems in a responsible manner and imparts a new way to take problems in one's stride."
The Subtle Art,Debajyoti Thakur,Too much realism to handle,4,Mark Manson discovers the real side of the universe for sure. The book is written in simple language and if you binge read it then it will be a matter of hours before you are done with it. To be honest the book leaves a lasting imprint on you for sure. The writers perspective is that of realist and it challenges the notions of idealism at every step. So a great book to read during your summer holidays with a cup of coffee or tea and introspect about your vision towards life.
The Subtle Art,Akash deshmukh,great wisdom,4,"If you are feeling demotivated, if you are always worried about little things, give this book a try. It might change you way of looking at the things."
The Subtle Art,Adarsh,Paper Quality!,4,The quality of the pages is below average! Although the book itself is awesome!
The Subtle Art,Ovn,One of the best books out there in terms of sheer honesty and ...,4,One of the best books out there in terms of sheer honesty and insightfulness. The book doesn't hold back its punches right from its first page and continues to tear down every facade and excuses you have built around you in your safe haven of entitlements. Many a times it leaves you with a sour feeling in the mouth but you'd realized by each chapters end it all was well meaning and probably well deserved too. It ironically is one of the best self help book for people who can't stand the bubble gum sugariness of pop self help books even though it clearly aspires to be a radical antithesis of the stock.
The Subtle Art,Adnan Ahmed Irshad,Don't think too much Just order and read it.,4,Category: Self Help Genre : Non Fiction People who think a lot and always have second thoughts about doing things should read this book. This books gives a perspective of the author how to have less thought about what people around you say and take that as a motivation and go on in life. This is one book which everyone who is starting to read books can start with. Go for it.
The Subtle Art,Bala S,A good read,4,"A surprisingly good and useful read if you are able to somehow look past the the extreme overdose of the F word in the first chapter, where the author comes across as just another naive blogger-turned-author. When I think about it now, I realize the first chapter is a decoy to significantly lower reader expectations as in the subsequent chapters the author takes his writing to another level, comes across as extremely well read and knowledgeable and offers great insights. I loved how each chapter started with an interesting anecdote and the takeaways from the chapter were directly intertwined with the actions or inactions of the characters from the main story"
The Subtle Art,Placeholder,Great book. Not so great paper.,4,I love this book. Have read it and also listened to audiobook. The paper quality is dull.
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,Inspiring and very light reading,4,Free flowing with nice anecdotes. The best are the examples and the intepretations of all that the auther makes it his own learning
The Subtle Art,Vaishnavi,Once you read it you get addicted,4,It targets you personally like a friend and criticising you and it's very real. Worth reading it.
The Subtle Art,Muhammed Hariz MS,Printing Quality,4,The product Is good But there are some printing problems like scartches it's surely readable . Its Better To Buy A hardcover than an paperback
The Subtle Art,Arunav Barua,Life lessons,4,"A look back at some truths that need to be reminded, time and again. We are, after everything, standing on a cliff."
The Subtle Art,Anish K George,Thought provoking,4,5 rating for the subject and the message. -1 for the language. Raw language is expected from seeing the book title itself. But some content is unnessarily added to just keep language style.
The Subtle Art,Jothimani Ravi,Recommended,4,I bought this for my friend. He is happy with the gift. Lol
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,The sharp knife,4,"A more genuine frank simple approach to understanding yourself and the world around you. Pierces like a sharp knife, letting out the basic truths of life. Sometimes they are hard to absorb, but at the end you understand it."
The Subtle Art,varun,Bright new way to look at things,4,"Mark Manson is giving us the same perspective as a few authors before him but with a funny new twist. The casual language, the use of anecdotes and flow within his writing make it easier to imbibe concepts such as ethics, morality, mortality and the self with more ease than we should be at."
The Subtle Art,Parth Bhatt,Different self help book than the run of the mill.,4,Mark Manson's international blockbuster is a nice book but a bit overhyped. The concept of embracing the problems and happiness results from problem solving has been written in a nice manner.The chapter on relationship is really good. The writing style is such that u will feel sitting just opposite to the author in a cafeteria.Overall it is a good book but I would not recommend it as a must read.
The Subtle Art,Irishdebbarma,A must read,4,A book that does not mince words and says what needs to be said. It's a book that writes a lot of what has gone through my mind a lot of times but I never cared to think about. A very good book written in plain manner. It is as true as our lives.
The Subtle Art,Divyansh,A great book indeed!,4,I was sceptical. I have read a couple of self-help books to become for positive in life. Then I came across this hyped book. I saw the chapter titles first. Too negative is what I felt. I read up and saw the contrast. It is amazing. Practical. Must read.
The Subtle Art,Ankur J.,Interesting Read,4,Interesting read. Becomes a bit repetitive and at times you feel as if author is countering himself. But a lot of learnings that you can take out of the book.
The Subtle Art,Harrish,This book is just about to embrace failure.,4,"The author conveys that being positive is always a loss. It leads to self-love, which leads to avoid adversity instead of confronting and overcoming it. He says that being positive always will make us fragile. This book is for everyone, but i would suggest to read this one, if you are fed up with failures and who needs motivation."
The Subtle Art,Ritesh Sinha,great read loved the way facts are stated,4,great read loved the way facts are stated. Worth reading once in a lifetime. Recommended for all book lovers
The Subtle Art,Safeer,Small crack on front binding...,4,"Have to say this.... Buying books from Amazon is always a pleasant experience. But this time, I bought a hardcover for the first time. But there was a small crack on the top as shown in the picture. Rest all good. Good delivery timing even during this pandemic time"

The Subtle Art,Ruchi j.,Good read,4,"It's good read overall, though the tone of the writer doesn't seem too joyful Infact it's sort of completely opposite of that but I really liked the book since it tells you the harsh reality of life and about how one should accept it."
The Subtle Art,SWARNAVA ATARTHI,Great book,4,Book condition was not good but overall all good.
The Subtle Art,Binoop V,"Headline was quirky, not the content",4,"Eye opener at times, relatable most of the times. His way of story telling is new and refreshing. Good read"
The Subtle Art,Manan,The original copy!,4,"If you are the one who need to know wheather it's original or pirated, know that this is original copy, if you want to know about book please reffer to goodreads, there you'll get to know about book more precisely."
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,"Good book, interesting perspective",4,"A very direct book that teaches you what to prioritize in life, and work towards achieving them. Good book to have hands on too and gain some perspective"
The Subtle Art,Ajay Shrivastava,Upto ur understanding,4,I am really not gonna talk about whats written in the book as it is gonna be based on ur understanding and u should expect a little dents on the book
The Subtle Art,Vincent V.,Good book,4,Would definitely recommended this book to everyone. It has a couple of good insights and forces you to think about stuff we are usually too distracted to think about. Easy to read and follow. No big words and accessible language. Wish many people would read this as it would genuinely help make the world a better place.
The Subtle Art,Abhipriya,Great Book,4,"Keeps you hooked. The title may be misleading but it is an interesting read. Depending on the stage of your life, you may like it or not. But definitely worth a read."
The Subtle Art,Aman thakur,It's a book about harsh truth about life which we basically ignore,4,Book basically talks truth with practicality . It basically measures success with happiness and logical thinking . But again I say from every book take those lessons with you which will help you grow in your life in your concerned aspect
The Subtle Art,Ved,Good read,4,"Although I find self help books boring, I found this book pretty interesting in beginning. The book brings out different approach to some basic problems in life. 4 star because it starts becoming boring at the end. Overall I liked it"
The Subtle Art,Namidha,Good Quality,4," The media could not be loaded. Quality of book is very good, but some of the pages are not in order."
The Subtle Art,Kallol Bhaumik,It's definitely not subtle.,4,I found this mostly about self realisation than motivation. Although i started reading without any expectation. I loved the writing style and the modern humour.
The Subtle Art,Sanjeev Attri,One of the best books I read,4,"I was really doubtful about my choice before buying a book from new author ,I am feeling the change in myself after reading this, there are many ares were you associate the yourselves with the experience shared in this book and it helps in coming out of the dilemmas, explanation on situations through different historical events is interesting and very effective."
The Subtle Art,Nishant,A clearer view towards daily curses of life,4,This book gives great insight and pragmatic applications as to how to handle life situations in the never-ending bombardment of various emotional torments one faces each day. A must-read. Nothing new but so well put together that it feels like all the wisdom spun giving a sheild to power your way through life.
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,Gives good perspective town life.,4,It's beneficial for those who bother the most on what people gonna think about them . It will help you not to think about other.
The Subtle Art,prasad waghmode,Focus on Life!,4,"Although the title and frist few pages has foul F word , but its worth a read. The best thing I felt was he dislikes the so called sugar coated 'positivity' , which is peached in today world.This lie positivity is dangerous illusion. This book has important lessons about focussing on things that matter , living responsibly and without entitlement. The book ends with chapter on death , which is very humbling to realize life's value."
The Subtle Art,Vikrant,engaging writing driven by profound intuition on the way of living.,4,The book explores around the idea of arranging our thoughts and action so as to focus on something worthwhile rather than trying to have it all. It dives into realm of everyday question of leading a good life in an engaging and direct way. I really liked the blunt style of the writing. I bet everyone will enjoy reading this book and more importantly it will force you to delve into your values and reanalyse it.
The Subtle Art,Vishnu Sreekumar,Really an eye-opener for the current generation...a must read,4,The author spits out the bitter harsh truth about the human lives and it may seem to be rude and offensive but its the reality. There are references and examples from the authors own life which makes the read interesting. Youll have a whole new perspective about life and death once you read this book.
The Subtle Art,Suyash Patekar,Absolutely an eye opener,4,I didn't like the concept of dissolving the ego. Hence my rating of 4 stars. However excluding that rest of the lessons outlined in the book are impeccable and can help build a solid foundation for a better future!
The Subtle Art,Komal,Original & Nice book,4,Achi book hai ..bought at 240 rs .
The Subtle Art,Mouli,Must read for those trying to achieve in life,4,This is just an awesome book. It just puts the fact in front of the reader and there is no BS around it. Loved the fact that it presents as life is and trains us to give importance about things that we really care and ignore others. Highly recommended for all age groups
The Subtle Art,Aishwarya,"Read , digest and then don't give a f***.",4,This is a book some us need to live by. A no nonsense guide to dealing or not dealing (depending on how you look at it ) with the bumps and bruises that we often waddle through .
The Subtle Art,Victor,A good one.,4,An honest book that challenges conventional ideas. Worth reading particularly for teens and young adults who are struggling to understand the reality of life and the world and how to respond to it
The Subtle Art,Muhammad suhail,Amazing art,4,The book shows the realities of life. The guidance the author spreads out is realistic instead of something superficial. Mere reading helps in appreciating our present life and helps us to feel energetic.
The Subtle Art,Kindle Customer,Ohh fakk,4,I would choose 4 because idk what to give a duck about and that is why most people give duck about everything.
The Subtle Art,sujata,Its good!!,4,Its really a nice book..
The Subtle Art,madhavgpai,Worth a try,4,"While the author talks of some difficult truths and speaks against entitlement, he also takes the liberty to assume a lot about people's behaviour to suit his narrative. Isn't that entitlement?"
The Subtle Art,Dr Isha Singh,Its a xerox,4,Its a cheap xerox copy. Hope youll know that. But a hardcover. Thats all.
The Subtle Art,Kautilya Kaushis,Liberating,4,This book lifts off thousand kilos of weight from our minds. It brought me to reality from a world of make believe. Good one
The Subtle Art,Neha hans,Simply wow,4,Amazed at how the author has used such normal examples to explain the most regular and simple things in life which we often complicate...this book leaves me in deep self introspection mode about the value of things that I give importance to in life. Definitely take the positives from the book. A good read!!
The Subtle Art,Shraddha Bhosle,Light read yet meaningful,4,Its okay to be an average person and being ordinary is just fine... Recommended as self help genre... Quite motivational if you dont know how to Move on ..
The Subtle Art,Alpha,GO FOR IT!,4,The condition when it arrived was not VERY good but okayish because there were few bend marks and scratches but it isnt very highlighted. A good read. Do read.
The Subtle Art,ADV. Vinay Srivastava,Some pages are up down,4,The media could not be loaded.
The Subtle Art,Vinay Dubey,Nice and boldly said few truths,4,There have been a bold discussion on some points which we avoid in our lives even knowing that those questions are important. Overall nice journey with the book
The Subtle Art,Arun,Good book,4,It's a good book for those who are looking for a self help book the title of the book gives us where we should give our f*** for Recommended for those who are looking for a self help book
The Subtle Art,Gitika,Ahhhh !,3,NGL . When I first read it . It helped me . But now I feel it's a little exaggerated thing to read . If you're struggling in your life with bad friendships and connections it's gonna give you a little guidance. But eventually when things settle down you'll realise you had a buddy a messed up one with you along the journey and that could be this book . The book quality is good .
The Subtle Art,AMARJEET,Good,3,Good
The Subtle Art,Ritesh J,Boastful writing!,3,"2.5/5. The book title is catchy for the obvious reason of having in it a 'F' word. It also starts with a lot of abusive language so much so that it gets irritating. Perhaps author thought that boasting about his rugged life as a youngster and use of abuse will give this book a cool feeling - but it absolutely doesn't. Overall it is a shallow writing and author has repeated the same old concepts little differently. Only because this is a small book and won't take more than 5 hours, I easily finished it. It feels like a very arrogant and boastful writing. The book has got very few interesting ideas or new perspectives. It stresses on focusing on our negative experiences and accept these as normal stating that 'The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of ones negative experience is itself a positive experience.' It claims that happiness comes from solving problems and how important it is for us to understand which problem do we like to solve to be happy. It talks about understanding and choosing right values for us. The author talks about the Five counter-intuitive values as below one can most beneficially- 1.Radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of whos at fault. 2.Uncertainty: the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. 3.Failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon. 4.Rejection: the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life. 5.Contemplation of ones own mortality: this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to ones own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective. The author continues to say that 'Often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it, and that we are responsible for it. When we feel that were choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable.' I liked below perspectives given by the author in particular- #We dont actually know what a positive or negative experience is. Some of the most difficult and stressful moments of our lives also end up being the most formative and motivating. Some of the best and most gratifying experiences of our lives are also the most distracting and demotivating. Dont trust your conception of positive/negative experiences. All that we know for certain is what hurts in the moment and what doesnt. And thats not worth much. #The 'Do Something'Principle - Action isnt just the effect of motivation; its also the cause of it. Action leads to inspiration which ultimately leads to motivation. So always 'Do Something'. #The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner. #When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them, and 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. Without the first step, there should be no attempt at reconciliation in the first place."
The Subtle Art,kratanshi chauhan,Good Read!,3,"This book is written by a star blogger Mark Manson The title of the book is the one which catch my eye &amp; it made me choose this book - The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*CK. I usually never go for self help books but this book was really good. The author dont try to keep on advicing be postive - be positive. Which is the best part i liked in it. This book will help you think and choose clearly what is important in your life and u should be concerned about and what's not important and you are wasting your time thinking about it. This book will not teach you how to gain or achieve, but rather how to lose and let go. It will teach you to close your eyes &amp; trust that you can fall backward &amp; still be ok. There were times when the authors really made me smile relating myself to his write ups. And making me think how silly i'm some time. Being a over-thinker i can say it can really help you with your overthinking, anxiety &amp; stress. The first half is good at end repeatedly reading same thing it made me little slow completing this book. Rest all i liked the book and it was good for one time read."
The Subtle Art,Mr Singh,DAMAGED BINDING,3,I specially ordered Hard cover because I love my books to be clean. Book Content is ofcourse great..but this shop where it came from..Omg...Placed all three books as it is...no protection..no plastic cover nothing..Binding is torn from sides.
The Subtle Art,Sheela Rama,Readable but not exceptional,3,"It had been a while since I read a book of nonfiction, Netflix proving to be too addictive. I picked this one on a whim, off one of the nonfiction bestseller list. The title was both puzzling and repulsive. The writer Mark Manson is in his 30s and writes a very popular online blog and gives out relationship and life advice. The book has some great advice on how you should not care too much about every little thing in your life and how to find things that you should care about. The things that matter and things that will make your life fulfilling. My favourite was happiness comes from solving problems. Dont hope for a life without problems. There is no such thing.Instead, hope for life full of good problems ....True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.. Some chapters in the book especially the anecdotes about some real people like the original Beatles drummer Pete Best and Japanese war hero Huron Onondaga were very entertaining. However the book does not have a flow. It is choppy and feels like edited pieces of his blog strung together, which it probably is. Language at times is crass which I should have expected considering the title. When a book makes to a top seller list, I expect it to be exceptional. This one is not. Readable yes. Will you learn something, sure..."
The Subtle Art,Prudvinath Malepati,It's not ground breaking and at the same not something to ignore.,3,"It's not ground breaking and at the same not something to ignore. I have seen some people pointing out to the danger 'that the author is suggesting us to be average'. If you we can understand the arguments, all he says is 'It's okay to be average at several things while trying to master things that really matter to us'.There I said it. Now, coming to the book, even though there is coarse language at the beginning, it doesn't appear that often throughout the book. If you have already read some books about personality development, then you might not find anything new in the book. But, you get a chance to listen to the same words from a matured friend whose Emotional Intelligence is one level above than yours. Although, the last two chapters are a little underwhelming and especially the eighth chapter where I lost the thought process of the author, the other parts of the book are worth reading, at least once. This book does break some delusions and throws the truth on your face saying that 'you are not special after all'. But wait, this book also gives you a couple of insights on 'how to be the one you always dream of, aspired to be'. Thanks :)"
The Subtle Art,Ranjeet Barsa,Good,3,Good
The Subtle Art,A,Book quality is ok ok,3,The media could not be loaded. The paper quality is not upto the mark. Very thin and dull
The Subtle Art,RIYAN ARANHA,Damaged cover,3,I replaced the book as the one I received 1st was with a very bed cover damage. But unfortunately the replaced book too was a bit damaged here and there. Quite disappointed
The Subtle Art,Hemachandran.T,Nice book,3,Good book Without any damages Fast delivery
The Subtle Art,Pushkar,To be read in your 20s,3,This is a very basic book trying to tell us about things that are really important in life. Maybe im reading it too late. Already read many such motivational books. Simple ideas. The author drawing from his own life experiences is a nice human touch.
The Subtle Art,harish,Ok type,3,It's ok type printing
The Subtle Art,Devi,Hated to read further after false memory,3,"Super fun and too much truth till he touches 'False memory' topic,sorry man,this authour was so much insensitive towards real victims and he thinks all sexual harassments are because of complaint from false memory from victim. He also elobarates about 'Jennifer Aniston' tits as if she is a toy and inanimate object. First half of book is good to read because its fun to read,also here and there so much real factors me said. But last few pages were written like so much insensitivity though serious topic like death,he didnt deliver them seriously, He is open 'anti-feminist' and lucky authour to publish and became famous because of his weird topics. I don't know how can people take him as a role model,seriously America need to question itself for making this authous this much famous."
The Subtle Art,Sonaal khanna,It is ok,3,"It started off quite good but inb the end I could not really make sense of it. While reading the book, I realised that I know most of the stuff :)"
The Subtle Art,Ravindhar,Bad Book print quality,3,The book quality is bad. Looks like a duplicate print. You can see the inks spill here and there. The print is different from chapter to chapter. Paper smudges are common. Could improve the quality.
The Subtle Art,Amazonking,Ok,3,Ok
The Subtle Art,Malay Choudhari,Good Book.,3,Faded front cover.
The Subtle Art,Good,Book,3,Like it
The Subtle Art,Gokul. K. Anil,"Great content, but cheap quality",3,"The content inside the book is nice and funny. Mark Manson did a pretty good job explaining many things with humorous and all. But the seller really played me by giving a book which looks and feels like it has been used for over 1 year. The paper quality is worth mentioning, it's shit. And the cover looks like someone thrown this book and dragged it across the floor a few times over. I would suggest buying this from some other sellers or any other sites. Sometexts are not even properly visible. I bought it by paying Rs. 299. I think it is the price of the content. The physical copy worth zero bucks imo."
The Subtle Art,Pravin Tiwari,Hardcover copy quality is not good. It's damaged at the corners.,3,Content is excellent but the quality of the hardcover copy which I received is not good. It's damaged at corners.
The Subtle Art,Sumit,Don't go for hardcover,3,Please don't buy the hardcover copy. It is same as the paperback. Although the book is good but don't buy the hardcover copy.
The Subtle Art,Mike,"Great book, faulty product.",3,"I didn't expect this product to be a true masterpiece. I was expecting it to be an OK book with a wannabe author, but when I read a couple of books then I realize the immense power of the life changing-advice that this book offers. I was not happy with the quality of the book though. A couple of pages in the book were torn and there was no way to return the book as it came sealed in plastic packing material. If I had to return it, Amazon's condition is to return it with the original packing. Disappointed with the delivery, not with the content."
The Subtle Art,Swasthik Reddy,All good but......,3,"there are small pen or pencil lines inside the book on every 4th or 10th page, it's barely visible but its seems the book it a refurbished one... Some lines in some chaptes are fading away(looks like that), lile the book has been bleached or something.. the Pen or pencils lines are so annoying."

The book start led of really good, telling us various point and facts that we need for our lifetime. They were being explained with various examples and instanced from life. But as we reach half of the book they are being repeated in one way or the other. But they have been put forth in simple and unstanding to reach all the readers of the book"
The Subtle Art,Nitin,Hardcore is same as paperback,3,There's no difference in hardcore and paperback version don't wate more money on harcore
The Subtle Art,Meena Yadav,Weird product,3,Pages are misplaced
The Subtle Art,Sharan,Pretty Good Book,3,"This is a self-help book; one of those where the author shares his own experiences with reckless behaviour and how we should strive to be better. There are some interesting stories here. However, there are stretches that test your patience. The author does give some sensible advice but it leaves you wanting for something more refined."
The Subtle Art,Karan,book is damaged from the sides.,3,packaging was good but book was damaged..paper quality is good
The Subtle Art,Chaitra,Not very helpful,3,There are no practical tips given to improve yourself in this book. It's only like reading a story... The author has given some suggestions but not how to execute it. Over that the price of the book is also more.

The Subtle Art,Hk,Let me be honest,3,"You can read it but it no where comes near to actually the truth of life, It might give you some satisfaction in the shorter run, maybe some Smith insights but nothing deep and what he talks about in my opinion neither is a practical way to live nor the truth. Although I have to say, when you read it it would be fun."

The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Book cover didn't look like a new one,3,Good read but looks like it's a used book. Hope Amazon does a better quality check before shipping them
The Subtle Art,Gujjuboy,Not sure !!,3,May be a counterfeit....not sure... Book is good though but not that impressive.
The Subtle Art,Simran,Very overrated!!,3,I didn't like this book at all. It is different from other self help books. At first I enjoyed reading but then the author was repeating the same thing time and again. The author was trying very hard to convey us the message. The title is delusionol. I tried very hard to complete this book but I failed miserably.
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Mad book,3,"I would love to call it a mad book contracdicts its own explanations. At times, while reading i was completely disconnected with what the author wants to explain.... Not very happy....overrated"
The Subtle Art,Placeholder,Very Light on Material,3,"Found a lot of it boring, simpply because I knew it already, and the author's personal stories are sparse. I understand how people might like it though. Meh."
The Subtle Art,Shilpa Goel,Rating is for the condition of the book,3,"The content of the book is great but I cut two stars for the condition of the book. Its coming out of the binding, font is too small and it is not printed in proper alignment with the margins. I hope Amazon didnt send a pirated copy at my place."
The Subtle Art,Jaffar,"Book is good , packing is bad",3,"Everything is good except packing , it got damaged during transport"

The Subtle Art,Achyuth Varma,Poor printing.,3,"It was good but book I bought, printing was pathetic. Lines where over lappednand blurred."
The Subtle Art,Sagar,For the freshers,3,If you starting reading non fiction than this book is for you. Written in simple words. It will not fall up to your expectations if you have read more books on this subject. Though no one will regret reading this.
The Subtle Art,Billy Gunn,Good premise...,3,... but looses its way somewhere along the way. It seemed to me like the book had a lot more to say but got lost along the way.
The Subtle Art,Chiranjeevi.N,Seller issue. Book quality was perfect,3,The outer book cover was torn and pages inside the book were damaged too
The Subtle Art,amey puranik,Honest attempt,3,"I really hate myself to give 3 stars, since it's a good book and bestseller... But as said in acknowledgment by author it is messy!! and little more repetitive."
The Subtle Art,Diya,Didn't like it much,3,"Overrated. Didn't like it much. There were times I felt the author is contradicting himself. In the first few pages he tries hard to convey the message that you are plain average but towards the end of the book he conveys the opposite - that you are special :) It is different from other self-help books in the way that it doesn't glorify you as someone who is unique and one of a kind. He says that feeling entitled is the reason why people care about unimportant things the way they do. So don't get confused by the title (like I did), the entire book is more about how to not take yourself so seriously. P.S: If you are looking to feel good, this might not be your cup of tea."
The Subtle Art,amol,Book makes you realize who you are,3,Life lessons to improvise on situations you face in day to day life. Thoughts are as relatable to you..good book

The Subtle Art,R.karunakaran,Good,3,Easy to read
The Subtle Art,Shivani,Useless,3,Delivery was fast. Quality etc all good. Coming to the book: one sentence/same thing repeated in different ways. I mean the title of the book is again and again stated in different manner.
The Subtle Art,Himanshu,Maybe good for someone or maybe not.,3,basically Mark try's to tell people how they mess with their own mind.
The Subtle Art,Rohit Nair,Failed to give the feel of a new book,3,"The book didnt seem to be in a new condition. It failed to give a feel of the fresh book. But wanted it urgently, so no harm done."
The Subtle Art,Zain,Interesting way of deciding should matter to us.,3,There were many life lessons in the book. It basically captures what most of us already know but in a more mainstream conversational way.
The Subtle Art,Karna,Don't buy if you have already read few good books on self help,3,This book is old wine in new bottle. All concepts to learn from this book are old but presented in bit different way which you can easy see on Mark's blog. So buy it if you want to reread traditional ideas of happy life in different style.
The Subtle Art,RADHAKRISHNAN,The subtle art,3,The contents of the book is too fragmented. It doesn't binds the readers attention. Though there are couple of good example mentioned.

The Subtle Art,Aditya Gautam,Damaged product recieved,2,The book backcover was torn along with couple of last pages. Book seems to be old or used. Replacement requested
The Subtle Art,Nitin,"Great book, poor copy",2," The media could not be loaded. I hate to leave negative or even neutral feedback, especially for a new seller. The book turned out to be a hardcover copy, as described in item description. Cover sleeve looked great. However, when I opened the book, I felt something amiss. For one, the hard cover (inside the sleeve) does not have the name of the book printed on it, which is unusual. Name is on the side of the actual book (see photo). Book is readable. But the printing and the paper is such that it gives the impression of this not being an original copy, but more like a ripoff, printed using offset printing. I am not sure if all books are printed using offset, but I just didn't like this particular book, is all. The title printed on the first page is quite hazy (see photo). The paper does not have the typical 'aroma' that other books have. But it might be difficult to prove this. So I choose not to return the book, or lodge a complaint with Amazon. The binding is such as the book doesn't remain open if you don't hold it open in your hands (see video). Which is also unlike other hardcover books."
The Subtle Art,ullas,Average,2,About 50% of the book is readable and about 10% can be used.. Which is great and is more than most self help content out there. Talks a little too much himself for a person who dissolved his ego :)
The Subtle Art,harshith giri,Stupid book,2,I won't recommend this book to anyone
The Subtle Art,saurabh dixit,Poor Quality,2,"The book is looking old and the quality of the pages is very bad, it was feel like I'm reading an old local book."
The Subtle Art,Range Rover,Physical quality of book is bad,2,The book is great. The print is bad. Yellowish pages where you can see text on the other side of the page as well. The book did not came with the usual plastic wrap. It was bent in different places. Probably an used book. I bought the paperback 2016 edition from Cloudtail seller.
The Subtle Art,Placeholder,nice book but received in bad condition,2,nice book but received in bad condition
The Subtle Art,Placeholder,Book cover in bad shape,2,The product quality is very poor. The cover of the book is in bad condition almost looks like its torned out or had been in a rough travelling journey. Kindly try to provide value for money.

The Subtle Art,N.karthikeyan,not satisfied,2,not good book
The Subtle Art,Suchithra S,Does not worth the hype!,2,"This book does not worth the hype. There is nothing special, a self help book using reverse psychology and millennials favourite curse word... anyone with little bit of reading and/or some world experience feel and think the same way. The last chapter is very boring. Teenagers and people in early twenties might find it interesting."
The Subtle Art,Amutha,Very bad outer cover quality.,2,Very bad storage quality and lack of responsibility. Print and paper quality remains good.
The Subtle Art,Paljor,Poor...,2,The cover page is quite poor. There are some faded words. Feel like I bought a book from a nearby local market. And the most important the book isn't looking like in a original form.
The Subtle Art,jinesh jain,Average,2,This book is good. But what i feel is that rather then reading this book you should just stop bothering about people and their opinion.. you don't need to read a book for same!
The Subtle Art,Aps,Catchy title ok book,2,"The title is the only really catchy part, rest i found it to be a very ok book. Not for me"
The Subtle Art,Suman,Very immature,2,"Nothing that's not already known...Spoken in a very unacceptable language. It definitely speaks of the person's own journey and loud thoughts rather than a book or a guide in anyway. Really sympathize with people who have taken this to be their guide for life. It's full of contradicting ideas, and lacks gravity. A total waste of time! Sorry I ended up paying for reading this."
The Subtle Art,Himanshu tripathi,"Hope I m being subtle enough,",2,I want to exchange my copy for a pair of socks..
The Subtle Art,Shivani s.,Little disappointed,2,This book contains only 212 pages and amazon mentioned 224 pages. I'm little disappointed with this.

The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Not satisfied with the quality.,2,"The delivery was on time but the condition of the book was not so good. The print is bad, pages were creased, has blotched ink, spots and smudged words . It looks like copy of the original book. Instead of buying this one, get the original one."
The Subtle Art,HappinezzKey,Highly overrated book,2,"Nothing new with it. It was just the catchy title, rest is 80% same as any self-help book. The author uses so much f-word here and there for any simple vocabulary! People who use such language need the first help!"
The Subtle Art,Nisha Deka,Bend lines,2,"The book was delivered to me in not so perfect condition , there were bend marks which I hate the most in a book I am purchasing"
The Subtle Art,tisrishrg,they will feel good about themselves in the short run but in the ...,2,"this book can actually make some people arrogant, overconfident, selfish cocky,,, they will feel good about themselves in the short run but in the long run they'll mess up their minds. there were few points that i found useful other than that this book is clearly overrated. try mind-calming meditation books"
The Subtle Art,MANOJ,Two star for the printing quality.,2,Didnt expect this from amazon. Book is a good read. Check the quality first. Its bad between the book. Thats why I didnt notice it when it came to me
The Subtle Art,Anuj,Not impressed!!,2,Overrated!!! And overly Hyped!! Personally I don't agree with author's perspective. But again depends upon person to person whether you find it worth a 'must read' or a 'trash bag'.... PEACE
The Subtle Art,Shivangee Arora,Only the title is interesting. Book doesn't serve well.,2,Only the title made me buy. However there is nothing in the book that hit hard. No take aways no punches and no real learnings.. just the one to be kept in the book collection because of the title.
The Subtle Art,Hemant Verma,Content wise the book is good..,2,Content wise the book is good...however the quality of page is very bad. Same book I saw at Delhi Airport T1 and the qualify of that book was amazing. The book which I received from Amazon is not up to the mark as far as quality is concerned.
The Subtle Art,Nightcrawler,Don't buy the hardcover,2,Don't buy the hardcover. Fake print.
The Subtle Art,Shameena,Not worth the hype,2,"Not worth the hype for ones used to this genre. For new readers of self help books, may be it will seem good. I found nothing unique or interesting that helped me."
The Subtle Art,shashwat sharma,Waste of time and money.,2,Author has no idea what he is talking about. Total waste of time and money. Don't know why people like it.
The Subtle Art,Shrujan K,Disappointed,2,I was very excited to ready this book. The first two chapters were very nice. Somewhere down the book it all got boring. He preaches the same lessons like any other books.
The Subtle Art,Imran Mallick,Over hyped,2,The most over-hyped book of the recent time.
The Subtle Art,abhi,Bad quality,2,I got an scan print copy. Bad paper quality with misprints. Book looks absurd. Retailers printing book from original or kindle edition which effects book quality.
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Normal self help book,2,Nothing new..same thoughts as in the other self help books... The book caption did all the marketing.
The Subtle Art,Mayank,Apparently not for Indian readers...,2,Every chapter seems like another blog post and nothing like the title.. alot of 1st world problems are being discussed in it which not even exist in our culture.
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Its like telling a person who is down to ' snap ...,2,"Got the message that the author wants to convey but language is brash, maybe purposefully so, and very ' american' in its approach. Its like telling a person who is down to ' snap out' in a slightly convoluted way."
The Subtle Art,Abhishek Shukla,Try ' who will cry when you will die' it's a better book and more practical,2,"Read only if you have not read any other help book. Nothing new, just repeatition of same theory in new words. Try ' who will cry when you will die' it's a better book and more practical."

The Subtle Art,T Sandeep,Not many stories or experiences to remember,2,A couple of examples about Beatles and Japanese warrior are interesting. Rest is ok but with a lot of self development content
The Subtle Art,Pallavi Vytheeswaran,First few pages missing,2,First 10 pages of the book is missing but otherwise good quality
The Subtle Art,meet pabari,Damaged Product,2,the book was bit damaged......so really dissapointed.....i like to preserve my books perfectly....but dis one i got damaged......NOT COOL AMAZON.

The Subtle Art,Nishchey,Audiobook feature is locked,2,"This ebook on Kindle does not come with Audiobook (Text to speech) by default. For that, you have to make a trial account on Audible which requires you to put in your debit card info."
The Subtle Art,Rahul,Lacks Logical Consistency,2,"The book will help you figure out a few psychological points about yourself. But mostly, it's not consistent with logic and that's why it becomes so boring on most of the pages. A self help book or any book must convince you with its story or subject. It does partially."
The Subtle Art,Azmin haque,Wastage of time and Money,2,Tired of reading the word f*ck and s*ck and bored.Hipster junkie kind of words..Streching the same words again and again..I think the author should learn the subtle way to convey his words.
The Subtle Art,Kanav Gupta,There are other better books,2,Honestly a boring book. It highlights most of the things that we already know and doesnt help much when it comes to self-help.
The Subtle Art,Saumya suri,Writing is dull and bit repititious,2,"I won't recommend this to readers who have been already caught up with multiple self-help books and resources. Probably for new readers, this book can be an eye opener. Having said that, this is Mark Manson's first book and it seems that he assumed a lot of his beliefs to be truth and wrote in an almost condescending style as if this is the only philosophy for life. I agree to his ideas to large extent but not the way it is presented. Nevertheless, given the hype and the catchy name you may give it a shot, sometimes reinforcing ideas you already know is also helpful, but surely there can be better books to spend your time on."
The Subtle Art,Vinni Poonia,Boring,2,Tried many times to read it but i did not what the author was trying to say or prove.I believe that even inspirational books can be intersting which is not the case here.
The Subtle Art,Arpit Srivastava,A below average book marketed well,2,This book is an example of average product marketed well. Starting from the name itself the book caught attention of everyone around me. So much that it almost became a fad to carry this publically. Picked it up to discover whats so special and to my surprise found nothing. The writer sounds self obsessed throughout. A lot of takes on issues are way to unrealistic. Looks like focus is more on sounding cool using the F*** words and forcing in self indulgent excerpts here and there. By the end of the book the writer starts self contradicting the points made in the begining. Not much to take away.
The Subtle Art,Shantanu Kundu,TOTALLY COUNTERINTUITIVE!!,2,EXCESSIVE STRETCHING of just simple ideas...

The Subtle Art,rahul,Overrated,2,I don't know why this book has this hype. Overrated.
The Subtle Art,Pratiksha,Poor use of language,2,The language used is of poor taste. A literature lover might not necessarily like luke this book. The content matter does make sense but its very coarsely put together.
The Subtle Art,razeen,Piracy Alert..!!!,2,"The book is good; however the print looks like a pirated version. The first look itself was so much demotivating. Not expected such poor quality from Amazon. If wanted a pirated print, I would have bought it from a footpath hawker for much less a price..!!!"
The Subtle Art,Rajni Rethesh,Not a great read,2,"I am still not sure whether I liked the book or not. I started reading The subtle art of not giving a f**k with lot of expectations. It did fulfill it in the first few pages. The pages where the author talks about Charles Bukowski; about his wayward life and then an unexpected positive diversion in his life ( a publisher takes interest in his writing) at the age of 52; that gave little hope. The thing that attracted me in this book was the epitaph on Charles Bukowski's tombstone 'Don't try.' It triggered my curiosity. Honestly, I was tired of reading all those positive outlook books. I mean, it kind of feels fake to me. And there was this book that said 'Don't try' too hard. Be as you are. However, sifting through pages, I felt the book took a complete diversion from where it started. He was talking about good values, entitlement, all that stuff. *Yawns*. Though, he does reiterate on accepting our fear and flaws and then moving forward in life and all, at some passages he has contradicted his statements. The beginning was full of the unnecessary usage of f**k (I think the purpose was to sound cool and all); later on the book sounded too preachy. He sounded like a parent or a grandparent who has seen and done everything in life but wants his kids to lead a zen life. He talks about the same positive stuff that others talk about but in a roundabout way. I have had too much of positivity for the day. Duh! PS: No offense to people who loved the book. Self help books fill me with too much of sarcasm. Sorry "
The Subtle Art,gautam sasidharan,Reading it is a choice,2,"This was one of those books which created curiosity in me. Alas, I was left disappointed. For anybody who has read a lot of self help books, this book is not going to make any difference. It is one of those books which can be termed as a primer for those who have not been initiated into self help genre. The book is roughly divided into two parts. The first tries to establish the authors ideas and the second grows further on this establishment. The book says that failure is normal and asks us to not corrupt it with positivity. The author argues that we are all comforting ourselves in an attempt to cover up failures. Its crux is about not alleviating the problems but trying to understand and sort them. The book explains that the most significant thing which occupies anybodys thoughts is unhappiness. And we find solace in denial and victim mentality ending up asking for entitlement. The author says that we are all living in a delusion that we are special and to come out of it we need to redefine the metrics against which we measure life. This book is devoid of any mysticism, spiritualism and saintly stories. It takes you through the process of breaking your mental picture of things and approaches the cube from a different side. As a matter of fact, it explains what all other books have been advocating in the positive manner, through a negative approach; a kind of anti therapy. Having read this much, it also explains how best these negative approach can be tackled and a normal life can be lead without hassles. A welcome offer, when we consider most of us being normal people. (I find a hint of the books influence in this line.) For me this book did not connect but for the last chapter. I believe that one of the main reasons the book owes to for its success is the language which comes as interesting and admonishing in an attempt to drive home the point. At some instances, the language used gives you the feeling of given a tight slap. Overall, it was an okay read for me and would recommend to those who have just ventured into the self help genre. Certainly a book to be chewed but whether it is digestible depends upon each ones gut."
The Subtle Art,Sweeti Gupta,It's duplicate,2,Shipped duplicate books.
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Cheap quality,2,"The quality of book is cheap.It's not the original,it is suppose to have 224 pages, but it has only 212 pages and price tag they keep is 499 and shows some discount. It is a fake one so they are giving the discount. Just started to read the book, will review the content later."
The Subtle Art,Ayush Saxena,Fake copy,2,Not a genuine copy.
The Subtle Art,Jani,Quality of Book is Pathetic,2,"Quality of book is very bad infact pathetic i must say. Paper of book is also so of bad quality and dull doesn't makes you feel to read the book and cutting of book is not aligned, so most of pages of the books are cross so entire written material is cross. Infact looking at such quality it seems to be pirated copy."
The Subtle Art,Romit A.,Poor condition of the book. Mold on the pages,1,The book is in a very bad condition. It seems like it is atleast 10 years old.
The Subtle Art,Raja,"Poor paper quality, Cant use Highlighter",1,Extremely poor paper quality for the price. Bought hardcover version. But it doesnt even below average. Feels pirated one. Im not complaining content. Content is great.
The Subtle Art,Not that good I just hate the wordings and the way of writing bood #notintrustingatall,No intrusting at all,1,I dislike this bood even I was not able to consente because I feal boar while reading
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Trash,1,"The Title of the book was very catchy. I have in the recent past given too many 'Effs' and I really want to start giving less 'Effs' or rather 'Effs' about the important things. This is what the blurb and title of the book promised to help the reader with, and this is covered only in first chapter although there are many contradicting statements in that as well. The next was unrelated to the whole thing about not giving 'Effs' but was still decent. From then onwards the book (is it supposed to even be a book ? ) went on rambling nonsense , and from the middle of the book, from the chapter on not believing what we believe the book became TOTAL TRASH. Surely the things we believe may seem absurd 500 years from now, but what was he trying to get at.? How is it at all relevant to the Title ? Even after that there is nothing in this Trash. I regret buying this consumerist, superficial JUNK of a product ."
The Subtle Art,John Joshua,The subtle art of not writing a book - a counterintuitive approach to write a book review,1,"Like all books that I started, I began this book with great expectation. Like every positive thinking author, he portrayed the existing feeling of meaningless that we feeling during stints of depression. So, I was expecting a rational, novel process to handle the problem. But, Mark disappointed me with his extended blog (not a book). I didnt feel like I was reading a self-help book. His potty-mouthed language didnt add any useful flavor to the points he re-iterated. Even some of the insights he mentioned were from the already available self-help market. I didnt know such trash could garner so many readers around the globe. Nevertheless, could give him a Hi-Fi for narrating some good stories (not his lifes) like the ones of Hiroo Onoda. To round it all up, this book is a complete disaster and a shame to the self-help market. Cant believe such a catastrophic author has 2 million subscribers. Rating I gave 1/5 stars in Goodreads for the good stories in this disorganized book. I do not suggest this book for reading. This book wont make you have a good life but will turn you into a foul-mouthed like the book title. The only takeaway, I have from this book is the subtle art of not writing a book."
The Subtle Art,Sandeep Singh,Abusive title,1,"Not for me, i have read better books than this. 4 agreements is far more better than this. Waste of time."
The Subtle Art,Raksha,The world thrives on mediocre authors!,1,"After the first 4 chapters, which were promising, average but promising, the book goes downhill. I hung on, gritted my teeth, and read it cover to cover just to extract the value of the money I spent. Its almost like the author had to complete his book deal of 60,000 words (guessing!) of raw manuscript with the publishing company, and struggled to pull it through. That, he had forgotten what life lesson he was trying to drill into his readers, shortly after he started putting this book together is evident, as after a time the content just meanders aimlessly. Its a pity that such undeserving-to-be-published books are Bestsellers on Amazon and worse, I see it has got wonderful genuine ratings. So does the world laud only mediocrity these days?"
The Subtle Art,Srikant Kumar Jena,Didnt like it personally,1,A lot better books are there than this.. its not for 20% .. its for 80% people
The Subtle Art,Brvp,Overrated!,1,Terrible book and overrated i lost intrest when author tried to convey emotion as something we choose everyday but thats not true in cases when u lost someone in ur life and feel sad depressed its a natural emotion that is not to be controlled or chosen to be sad and i felt that author doesn't had any clarity about what he actually whats to say i cant believe i wasted my time on this. This book is no way a self help book
The Subtle Art,ishwar,Bakwas book. Worst book,1,Bakwas book. Worst book
The Subtle Art,Mohammed Arif,Only first chapter worth reading,1,"Honestly except the first chapter I did not find anything new or counterintuitive as the author claims. I have read a lot of self help books, but this one sucks and actually one another one (Think and grow rich). There is nothing counter intuitive in the book, but the author has diligently put all his learning between the covers."
The Subtle Art,Sunny,Waste of Money,1,"If you wanna waste your money and time, then you may read this book....... Its basically a diary entry of a millennial only with excess cuss language. And even if you try to ignore (though hard to) the English language of a teenager in which this book is written and try to understand the message the author is trying to convey, you'd be hard pressed to do so because there is none. The book would at times contradicts it's earlier advice only to suggest something equally worthless as you progress. Don't Judge a book by its cover (or its title either)"
The Subtle Art,Chetan,Dont go for hardcopy,1,The media could not be loaded. I have got this yesterday but very unsatisfied with the hardcopy since it doesnt look look loke the new one so I wil return it since I have paid for hard copy to keep for long days
The Subtle Art,Akshay,very bad packaging & handling.,1,"5 dents!!! on the hardcopy edition. corners worn out. clearly the book wasnt handled properly &amp; packing was not up to the mark. Hardcopy edition are twice the cost of normal edition, so we atleast expect a good product. (Cost 450) content- 3/5 some ideas &amp; insights are very good, but some are confusing &amp; others are largely pessimist. But largely the book is worth one read."
The Subtle Art,Shils,Not good !!,1,"Just because the title carries the word F***, doesnt mean every 2nd or third line should carry the word F***. Made the book kind of boring and dramatic with use of the word everywhere. Not worth a buy at all. Avoid !!!"
The Subtle Art,Krunal Thakkar,Substandard product delivery,1,"The product quality is really very poor. It was a gift for my boss, and the complete experience was ruined by your team firstly by delivering defected product and after that by delivering product of substandard quality. Dont appreciate it at all. Pathetic."
The Subtle Art,Aditya,I think its over rated,1,"I think its too over rated. There is nothing special. What I feel is the most interesting part of the book is its title. There is nothing much inside. I seen many people feeling the same but, they dont give right feedback of this book just because its popular. I feel there is nothing special. Nothing to gain out of this book."
The Subtle Art,priyanka sharma,Not up to the mark!,1,"The book has its own mistakes, but the major mistake is in the chapter on Buddha! I mean come on you are writing a book yet you are still an amateur in your research skills! But it was a fun read somewhat!"
The Subtle Art,Shubham,Worst page quality,1,"Book is tremendous but page QUALITY too much poor , some words are missing"
The Subtle Art,Sandeep,Hopelessly bad book,1,"I got tricked into buying it because of the catchy title. A lesson for me to not buy books by reading its name. After a first few pages, the book is so predictable, that it was not necessary to continue reading.."
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Total waste of money and time.,1,Dont go for it. I read 2 chapters and after that I felt I should not waste any more time. Nothing makes sense in this book. No leaning. no value addition. rather it will discourage and miss guide you.
The Subtle Art,MEDHAJ KHANDELWAL,Overrated,1,This book had been glorified by a lot. But it is not that much worthy as expected. It's basically how author has an outlook on his way of thinking about life. Though some lessons in this book were good enough. Yet dissatisfied with its content.
The Subtle Art,M Lakshman sharath,Damage of Book,1,The media could not be loaded. Some page's in the book is missing. After page Number 24 I can see page Number 89 almost 65 pages are Missing and I see damage in pages inbetween the copy. photo copy of the pages is attached.
The Subtle Art,Ag,Terrible condition,1,Amazon doing what its best at ruining products. The binding of the books are not proper and many pages were bent and misaligned
The Subtle Art,Amazon Customer,Dont fall for the title,1,The best and most creative thing about this book is its title.after reading two chapters it feels like it is telling you Same old lessons in vey banal way.I waited chapter after chapter that now I am going to learn something new but in vain.I had such high hopes specially because of all the hype it created but this book is not much different than thousands of other self help book you read. If you want to read a better book go for Nicolas Taleb -black swan or thinking fast and slow which can give you real and scientific insights.
The Subtle Art,Amal,Good read but bad a product .,1,"Good book ,but this product seems really bad, printing issues on backcover as well as on somepages .backcover is kinda damaged .really bad packaging .no bubble rap or anything .bad quality .contents in this books are awsome but .I would to buy this one from offline market or from another seller ."

I repent now for giving my time in reading it(though few chapters) I don't understand how such books become international best sellers!.. I personally feel there are n number of books out there, which should be read by us, rather than these sort of books! Ps... I have just kept the book aside now..

Sapiens,Rahul Rai Khatri,Thoroughly Enlightening !!!,5,"BookReviewsFromHeart @ Blogger It's quite rarely when you came across a person or a book which just amazes you and a part of it just housed into your mind and brain. By the way , What do know about Humans(us) ? I was taught,like many others, in school that Homo Sapiens is the scientific name for Humans. Homo Sapiens -the species Sapiens(Wise ) of the genus (Homo) and is the only living human species on earth but none of them debriefed us anything about the conditions in which we actually arose . Were there exist only Homo Sapiens or there exist other human species too ? 100,000 years ago,at least, six human species inhabited the earth. Today, there's just one. Us. And What injected in the minds of kids at a very young age , including me, is that it's the climate which causes the extinction of many animal species . But is it a complete truth ? Few tried to find . Honestly, I didn't but this book answered so many answers to the questions which were not even budded in our brain . Magnum Opus this book is a wide-ranging and bold work of non-fiction which challenges everything we thought we knew about being human from our thoughts to our actions and even our future . Sapiens tabled the answers of intricate questions raised from curiosity while studying the history of our own species. Book is divided into four major parts- The Cognitive Revolution, The Agriculture Revolution, The Unification of Humankind &amp; The Scientific Revolution . Every Part is further divided into subparts &amp; gives ample description on the mentioned topics. In the first section, The Cognitive Revolution , Author talks about the existence of other human species that exist before Homo Sapiens and how Homo Sapiens turned out to be the environment serial killer which had annihilated many species including his own siblings and many other animals.This section also reveals the way of living of our ancestors and the little myths they create to bind the humankind. Next comes , The Agriculture Revolution, which explains that how our ancestors who were foragers and had the only aim to hunt and live renounced their practice of living a nomadic life and settled to sow and grow . How this decision of settling at a place for farming turned out to be the most decisive moment in the history of humankind which changed the aberrated the history and most importantly how Agriculture turned out to be the biggest fraud of history . our ancestors who usually stay in a band of 15-20 eventually start living in a group of 100s when the agriculture flourished , And after the agricultural revolution, human societies grew ever larger and more complex .Myths and fictions accustomed people, nearly from the moment of their birth, to think in a certain way and to observe certain rules. They thereby created artificial instincts that enabled millions to strangers to cooperate effectively and this network of artificial instincts is called 'Culture'. The Unification of Humankind holds the contents which were put into action many years ago to unite the mankind either with the help of 'Culture' or 'Religion' or 'Nations'. This section also enlightens about the crucial role played by different religions sprouted in the different part of the world to add more and more strangers in a community. Harari in this section depicts how Mythology helped in maintaining law &amp; order while money gave us something we can really trust. And the last section , The Scientific Revolution, which stretched for about 2nd half of the book gave us a clear glimpse of the beginning of the scientific revolution which introduced humans to their actual capabilities of being the wisest species on earth. Samen which lands us on the moon to manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. So Sapiens is a must read , thrilling and breathtaking account of our extraordinary history - from insignificant apes to the rulers of the world. It's quite rarely when you came across a person or a book which just amazes you and a part of it just housed into your mind and brain. By the way , What do know about Humans(us) ? I was taught,like many others, in school that Homo Sapiens is the scientific name for Humans. Homo Sapiens -the species Sapiens(Wise ) of the genus (Homo) and is the only living human species on earth but none of them debriefed us anything about the conditions in which we actually arose . Were there exist only Homo Sapiens or there exist other human species too ? 100,000 years ago,at least, six human species inhabited the earth. Today, there's just one. Us. And What injected in the minds of kids at a very young age , including me, is that it's the climate which causes the extinction of many animal species . But is it a complete truth ? Few tried to find . Honestly, I didn't but this book answered so many answers to the questions which were not even budded in our brain . Magnum Opus this book is a wide-ranging and bold work of non-fiction which challenges everything we thought we knew about being human from our thoughts to our actions and even our future . Sapiens tabled the answers of intricate questions raised from curiosity while studying the history of our own species.

Sapiens,Akhil Mohan,"Provocative, lucid and highly informative",5,"Lucidly, and for the most part, objectively, written, this book not only provides a succinct and wide ranging analysis of human evolution but also raises provocative questions that one cannot help but ruminate over. So much of what we think we know today is either a mere fad in the timeline of human evolution or in fact is an entirely baseless assumption. There are a few sections, such as the one on gender, where the authors analysis becomes visibly shallow, lacking in his otherwise rigorous dialectic, and is perhaps ideologically self-serving. But barring these, this book represents a rare instance of intellectually honest and unbiased analysis. Anyone who thinks this book is for historians or philosophers is sorely mistaken. It is for every thinking human beingor more correctly every thinking Sapiens."
Sapiens,Prerna,This book is a new perspective,5,"A must read to understand humans above our judgements. It show where you come from,how deeply your habits are rooted in once survival instinct. For me this book is a different kind of self help...knowing where we came from to decide where we want to go."
Sapiens,Vikalp,WHAT A BOOK!,5,Every expectation I had with this book was fulfilled and went beyond. This is a must read book for every living person. chapter after chapter it get better and better. One of the best book I have ever read in my whole life. Totally game changer. I feel more connected to the world after reading this masterpiece.
Sapiens,Placeholder,A must read for every Human a.k.a Homo Sapien,5,"Harari is a great story teller. He is also someone who asks the right questions at the right time, giving us thought provoking scenes and situations where you will keep on wondering if the fundamentals of life that youve learnt over the period of time are valid or not. Sapiens is a must read for everyone."
Sapiens,Tirth Patel,I think Harari's done pretty well here in terms of achieving those goals. Kudos.,5,"I see many people complaining about the wild leaps of logic and the lack of footnotes - but honestly, what did you expect in a 500 page book, not even with small print, that's supposed to give you a summary of all history from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the present day? Personally, I thought the basic idea was terrific: the author has taken it upon himself to defend the Book of Genesis and show you that it's all true. I have seen creationists attempt the same thing and fail miserably, with their pseudo-scientific explanations of why the Earth is actually six thousand years old, how the Flood explains geology, etc. None of this nonsense for clever Dr Harari. He doesn't bother arguing about the places where science has obviously got it right (the Big Bang, plate tectonics, evolution), but takes them as givens. He doesn't get into the tangled reasoning about where a Creator might come into the picture; here, there is none. Instead, he cuts to the chase and gives you a story that's actually very interesting. About ten thousand years ago, people largely stopped being hunter-gatherers and started being farmers. This is usually presented by modern commentators as a Good Thing. But in Genesis, it isn't: we are expelled from the Garden of Eden and forced to eke out a miserable existence tilling the unforgiving soil, and now we have to live with the consequences. We have had the presumption to eat the fruit of the Tree so that we may become as gods, knowing good and evil. Harari ingeniously defends the idea that this, more or less literally, is what happened. We became farmers, then we started developing better technology, then we constructed cities, and finally, very recently, we invented science. We have made the most of our position as lords of creation, driving many species extinct and turning a few others into efficient machines for producing meat. But none of this has made us happier. In fact, as the Bible says, it's made us more and more miserable. We're evolutionarily adapted for being hunter-gatherers, not software engineers or stock traders. We are on the verge of learning how to conauer death and make ourselves immortal: but even then, we won't be as happy as we were back in the Garden. We'll more likely find new and even worse ways to cut ourselves off from our true heritage. Harari takes the position that our great strength as a species, the thing that sets us apart from all other living beings, is our ability to make up stories about things that are only to be found in our imaginations, and then treat them as though they were real; by this process, they become real. As he points out, empires and religions and money don't actually exist, but now they rule our lives. He's particularly interesting on the subject of money. Again, I can see some readers who dislike what they call his cheerleading for modern Western society. I don't think Harari is a fan of the West, and the book is in my humble opinion not Eurocentric at all; for example, Harari seems to like Buddhism rather more than Christianity. He's just pointing out the indisputable fact that Western society has taken over the world, and he ascribes that, more than anything else, to the West's ability to make up a better story about money, which we call capitalism. If this is where you're coming from, talking about the power of myth to transform human existence, you don't go overboard with the footnotes. There are no footnotes in the Bible. You do your best to tell a great story, and you hope that it will transform our existence. I think Harari's done pretty well here in terms of achieving those goals. Kudos."
Sapiens,it is good and easy to use.,It's absolutely faaaaaaaantastic..,5,Book quality is good and Experience is quite well
Sapiens,Karthick S,A very indepth book on Human History,5,"Quite often I get this thought, 'The universe is large. There are so many galaxies and our solar system is nothing more than a speck. Earth is even smaller. Yet, we are the only known living beings. The history of Earth is so vast and it has been there for millions of years. Humans have been there for significant part. Yet, we live in a space with so advanced technology and process complicated stuff out of a tiny little thing in our head known as Brain. Why are we destined to do this?' Yuval Noah Harari has tried to explain this in the book Sapiens. It is an attempt to explain how have Humans come to this stage. The author defines three main timelines in the history of Homo Sapiens 1. Cognitive Revolution (70000 years ago) 2. Agricultural Revolution (10000 years ago) 3. Scientific Revolution (500 years ago) When we co-existed with the animals out there in the wild, we were not on top of the food chain. The ancient stone tools discovered are not designed to kill animals. They were used to break bones and eat the marrows inside (So, the big Cats hunt and then lesser animals eat the rest and then scavengers scavenge and after all that humans broke the bone and ate the marrow). Being that weak, Sapiens had a lucky intervention in the form of Cognitive Revolution. Most animals can communicate in some form, but none as detailed and as sophisticated as a Human. This created knowledge and helped humans form groups and communities. It is interesting that Gossips form an important means of communication. It helps establish trust (and it continues till the day). This was the phase when we were Hunter-Gatherers and Foragers. The author defines this as the best period of Sapiens. They had a relaxed lifestyle, worked less and were fit as they ate a mix of all nutrients. Interestingly, our liking for Sweets has been hardwired from this age. Sweets were such a rarity then and evolution made Sapiens gorge on any sweet they find as it provides abundant energy. Accidents have always been an important cause of turnaround in Human history. Agricultural revolution was no less. A few Hunter Gatherers found that the wheat they gathered spilled on the way and new wheat sprouted. Thus started the domestication. The author further says that it was actually plants like Potato, Wheat and Rice that domesticated us than we domesticating them. Growing these required lot of energy - you had to settle down, plough, remove weed, water and it consumes lot of time. And you end up with one type of food as against the Hunter Gatherers. And due to settling down the human population arose significantly. Thus bigger societies were forming with a big hope of tomorrow, although the life of a farmer was worse than that of a Hunter Gatherer. Hence, the Author calls Agricultural Revolution as the 'Biggest Fraud' in Human History. And this curse continues to chase us today as he says, 'How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.,' Agricultural Revolution led to unification of mankind in a way that could never happen with animals - we started having Fictional realities like Money, Country, Kingdom, God which doesn't exist in nature. The author digs deeply into three main factors that led to mass unification of Humans - Money, Empire and Religion. All of this leads to Trust and enable unification. As he writes, It is interesting how deep the author goes into each of them and analyze the pros of cons of each. He also touches upon and pity the domesticated animals that are treated in a very cruel way. 'Domesticated chickens and cattle may well be an evolutionary success story, but they are also among the most miserable creatures that ever lived. The domestication of animals was founded on a series of brutal practices that only became crueller with the passing of the centuries' In the final part, the author analyzes the reasons for Scientific Revolution starting out of Europe and how it changed the course of the world. He believes is started because the scientists accepted Ignorance in first place. They were ready to explore and gain knowledge. The kingdom supported them and eventually they conquered the world. He also explains the rise of capitalism and interlinking of capitalism and science. Finally, the author touches upon two aspects - the first one was something that I didn't expect the author would touch upon - Happiness. He tries to find out what exactly Happiness is and how do we define that. The last 50 years have infact been the best part of Homo Sapiens existence. In the entire past history, there was no such time of peace. Yet, does it impact happiness. We live longer than our ancestors. Are we more content? He feels that more research should be done in the field. The final concluding piece is the future of Homo Sapiens - Will we become Amortal? Will AI take over? Are we Cyborgs today? He looks into various possibilities that might become true. The depth and width of knowledge covered in this book is amazing. Every page has new information and he has tried to capture it as vividly as possible. Summarizing the book might provide some insights, but reading this book is something very different. Finally, there are few people who say our generation is the worst of the lot and our ancestors were close to nature. The author disagrees, 'The romantic contrast between modern industry that destroys nature and our ancestors who lived in harmony with nature is groundless. Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of life.'"

Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Every educated Homo Sapien should read this book.,5,"Indeed, this book is a milestone in the critical, balanced and multi-faceted presentation of human history on planet earth."
Sapiens,Girish,Provides the most insightful details on human history,5,"One of the best books I have ever read, the author presents a scientific analogy about human evolution. It explores what made humans dominate the world compared to other species. Cognitive thinking gave humans an edge, the invention of fire provided power over other species, and agriculture, language, religion, communism, capitalism, and socialism built the greatest super species on Earth. It was a breathtaking experience; I was so engrossed that I finished it within two weeks."
Sapiens,Amrik Ghosh,Brilliant read!!,5,Wonderful and thought provoking. A must read.
Sapiens,Anshu Rai,Thought provoking! A must read in 2023!,5,"There's one striking feature of this book, that is the storyline it has maintained or the continuity of the thoughts. The book starts by giving us an insight on the dawn of humanity some 70000 years ago. It gives a very imaginative play of how we are all ancestors of that one ape that went beyond the cycle of evolution. It goes on explaining how our ancestors thousands of years ago survived, what was their life like, their food pattern, and every possible detail of their life. And also gave an insight on how alongside living, early man too had a thing for destructing every thing that came his way, even their distant cousins Neanderthals. It talked about the Agricultural Revolution and its consequences both in terms of economic and social. It also talked in great depth about the Industrial Revolution and how it changed lives forever. But the book specifically gave great importance to the Scientific Revolution as it changed the course of lives forever. Lastly, the book imagined a future based on the evolution cycle and feared the godlike intelligent creatures are next in line and maybe, we, the homo sapiens will be the one who will go extinct this time, the way Neanderthals went extinct by our hands. The book will make you understand how history is the best way to predict the future. As when you will see through your own eyes the astonishing evolution of homo sapiens, you too will have to believe in the future the book is talking about as it seems as impossible as our evolution into man of today seemed 70,000 years ago. It's a book written in 2014 and reading it today in 2023 makes much more sense than ever because a lot of things that have been talked about in the book as developments are now full-fledged reality. I guess it is a kind of book that will make much more sense every time you read it because every time you will be reading some history with some future insights. It's a must read for those who are fascinated with the image of the future but it is not for those who are scared of change. For this book will certainly teach you one thing that change is the only constant. The unimaginable kind of change!"
Sapiens,Thomas,The best anthropology book of this century,5,"This book is extremely well-written. The English is easy to understand as the sentences are not very long. I was surprised to learn that there was a time when Homo sapiens was not the only human species around. What happened to the other species of humans? Read the book to find out. The author says that gods, nations, money, human rights, and companies are all figments of the collective human imagination. But these fictions enabled humans to cooperate in large numbers and build cities and empires."

Sapiens,arnab,Classic.,5,Contemporary and classic at the same time.
Sapiens,Hashim,Mind blowing insights,5,"This is the journey through time. The Author explains and analyses our evolution from stone age to where we are now. We can see how our actions as humans compounded over years and led us to drastic changes like the invention of agriculture leading all the way up to the industrial revolution and beyond. The book provides some wonderful insights such as how as people our collective belief in something made it real. Take currency for example. It only has value and meaning because we, as people, collectively choose to believe in it right? If not, how can a piece of paper be of any use to us? If these types of insights interest you, then you should definitely dive into Sapiens to find out more. The book itself is a bit long with around 500 pages. But dont let this discourage you, once you are in it, you dont even know the pages turning over."
Sapiens,Rohit Sharma,Youve got to know the reality of our times and past.,5,"This book can very well be reviewed and summed up in one sentence: We (Home Sapiens) have screwed this planet big time and unfortunately there is no going back hence it all is coming to an end - very soon. I do not like reading horror at all and this unfortunately is one of the scariest books I have ever read in my life - it scared the shit out of me big time the way Yuval has covered the History, where and how it all started to the present and a glimpse on the future too as in which direction we are heading. I am sure if you have read this book - you will totally agree with me here. Totally loved the clarity of his thoughts and how subtly he has put his point forward - kudos to him. For some reason I have postponed my reading of Darwin's 'Origin of Species', got it like two years back, still has it on my Kindle, have read couple of books inspired by his theory yet I am yet to read the one which started it all I guess. I have even read Matt Ridley's 'The Red Queen' which talks about the similar subject but isn't scary like this one. And let me finish this by saying that I am NOT AT ALL looking forward to Yuval's next 'Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow' that title itself is telling the whole story and imagine how scary it will be :). As I picked up this one which came highly recommended from loads of people, found it a little boring and a kind of a slow starter. I always thought Yuval must be a Japanese, Chinese or a Korean may be but to my shock and surprise he turned out to be an Israeli. Wow! I guess this is my first from someone from that part of the world and its incredible. The kind of research he must have done to come out with this perfect book which should be kept in a indestructible titanium box (should be Nuclear resistant too), so once the Homo Sapiens disappear from the face of this planet like the Dinosaurs did and a lot of animals and birds are getting extinct by the day do too - whoever finds this planet later should get an idea who we were and what we did to this planet. He hasn't left anything that needs a mention and has covered so much in those little over 400 pages that I found it incredible. The book after a boring and slow start just keeps getting better and by the time it ends - I actually wanted it to go on and on and I believe thats what he did with the sequel which I vow not to read as I have such a fragile heart and just cant take chances. This book should be made a mandatory read in school and colleges right before the next generation comes out and does exactly the same thing what we did and joins our hands in further destroying this planet. Although he doesn't offer any kind of solution in this one but at least we know what we are doing wrong now. But the $ million question remains unanswered - Are we listening to him and the likes? Is there a way all this can be stopped? Terrific book and a must must read for all. A definite 5/5 from me with a double thumbs up recommendation. If you have read it already - do let me know how you liked it and are you planning to read the sequel? :)"
Sapiens,NAVANEETH C P,Truly amazing,5,One of the most amazing narrative of our time
Sapiens,Binu,One of the good books that you should read,5,Definitely a must have
Sapiens,ANU LAL (Bestselling Author),From human to posthuman,5,"Sapiens underscores the Cognitive Revolution as the decisive geological/biological event that carved out a trajectory for Homo sapiens. The author raises several arguments to suggest that an animal of no special importance became a geological force 1500 years ago. The book tries to answer a few questions such as: 1. What is the significance of addressing human history regarding the cognitive revolution? 2. How is the agricultural revolution significant? What are the disadvantages the agricultural revolutions brought to humanity? 3. What's the importance of unification of a large number of members of the Homo Sapiens? 4. How does the scientific revolution endow the human species with superhuman potential? Each question is dealt with a clarity that could be attributed to the skill of the writer. Under several crucial subsections, each of these questions receives deeper elaborations. The text analyses the rise of the early species of humans under the part that discusses cognitive revolution. Several species of humans populated the earth until 70000 years ago when the Cognitive Revolution was triggered in Homo Sapiens in Africa. Gradually, Sapiens dominated all the other species of humans on the earth. In his evocative language, the author points out many research outcomes that prove that just as the only extant human species, the sapiens crossed paths with any of the other ancestral species of humans the population of those other species has deteriorated. Although the author does not point out the exact reasons for the disappearance of all the other early human species the certainty that their demise and their contiguity with Homo Sapiens is indisputable. The point of view that the author adopts to describe the agricultural revolution is a multidisciplinary one. When it says the agricultural revolution is history's biggest fraud, one has to wonder if history itself is alive, has a mind of its own. The major difference between animals and human sapiens is that sapiens can cooperate, coordinate, and function as a system under an idea. Animals are limited by a certain biological determinism. For example, a large number of ants can cooperate, often better than humans. However, the laws that govern their genes and biological systems bind them to function with a queen ant. No ant colony would ever revolt against an ant queen. Homo sapiens overthrew monarchies and ruling parties with a set of ideas or stories. Religion and money are shown as two major forces that played in favour of unifying sapiens across the globe. Finally, the scientific revolution transforms the potential of sapiens and makes them 'god-like' in their capability to transcend their natural barriers. By using advanced instruments on their body sapiens can magnify their natural strength, be it vision, heartbeats, or memory. The book argues that 1500 years ago, sapiens became a geological force. The final triumph was not just that of science in unifying and strengthening sapiens. There was yet another claim for the space of influence- from colonialism. The relationship between science and colonialism is narrated in detail."
Sapiens,Anasua,Racist views are real?,5,"Very interesting read, loved the ideas and concepts thrown up by the author, some of the theories are just revolutionary, they aren't always discussed openly as they might be considered racist by wokeists"
Sapiens,Umer Farooq Wani,Must Have For Book Readers,5,A Good Book To Read The History Of Sapiens
Sapiens,Devarshi Devesh,"Excellent book, will expand the horizon of your knowledge and perspective.",5,"This was money well spent. You obviously have a bias that this book is good because you're purchasing it. But when you start reading it you will find out that this is beyond good, it's excellent. It gives you so many perspectives to look at how things are. I'd highly recommend you read it."
Sapiens,Manjoy Acharjee,Good.,5,Awesome
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Must read if you want to know who we really are and whats ahead of us,5,"Am so blessed to have got hold of this piece of work which has deep insight on our evolution and how the entire world has got shaped into what it is now. Many of my thoughts, believes and way of looking at things have got changed post reading this. How ill fed we are or have been is quite obvious now to me. Just cant explain how deep rooted this book is. The perspectives and history around Gender, religion, capitalism, racism, reservation/quota system etc is mind boggling."
Sapiens,Avipsita Roychowdhury,Worth read,5,Great source of information.. Entertaining
Sapiens,Vinit Kumar,Best Books Retail Shop on Amazon(IND),5,"First of the quality of all books and prints are just awesome and flawless! I ordered 7 books from 'CocoBlu Retail Limited' Which Prices are in sequence as in pictures -69,211,164,16,161,104,47 You May Be Thought how I got all this books at very cheap price, b'coz I bought it in Great Indian festival . If you gonna to buy this books I would suggest you to buy from this seller. They also wrappes books in bubble wrap which is good part and of course do carton packaging. Most of sellers do plastic packaging which damages the books. The main thing I noticed that the quality of pages little bit compromised and are translucent in high lights so you should not read it in sunlight prefer the lamp or normal room bulb, So yeah that's it in this review!"
Sapiens,Vishnu,Page Turner,5,"The whole history of the humankind in 450 odd pages.. Yes, you won't be able to include everything in 450 pages. The book doesn't go in detail on modern day man of the 20th and 21st centuries. This book made me get my interest back in reading and I started buying non fiction books. I can say, anyone can read this book for fun or for academic purpose."
Sapiens,Vinay Rana,Loved the quality and speedy delivery,5,"I was worried about the quality of online books before buying them from online platform. I was so surprised by the quality of book. Page quality , printing , cover everything is so good."
Sapiens,MIDHUN M R,One of the best books I have read,5,This book gives us a new outlook to the world we live
Sapiens,Swetha K.,Expect this book to be a necessary book to finish in the education system,5,"I have close friend from college who has been hyping about this book for the longest time I know-note that we have been friends for almost 7 years now- it took me so long to first finally purchase this book considering how long I've known about it. I have to be honest, I'm not a strong reader when it comes to history, I often say with pride about how history books put me to sleep, to imagine a 25 year old me finally reading a book exactly about a fragment of history of human kind-its almost impossible, just as I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it when this book got delivered to me. Because it was that thick to begin with! But when I did,, I'll be damned because I just couldn't put the book down. Let me revive a few things that this books talks about: - biology -evolution -psychology of humankind -anthropology -economics &amp; finance -medicine -philosophy -paleontology -environmental science -agriculture -religion -scientific intervention I literally haven't finished 5% of what's spoken well in this book. This author is unbelievable- because for one eh thought me so much in 10 days than I could finish my school graduating with useless information that he managed to do. I strongly believe this book has to be made possible for a compulsory read in school-I honestly trust school children to understand this language. Which I forgot to add on the fact that the language is so simple that the author has used enough for me to skid through the pages after pages. Only reason I couldn't finish without loosing interest what the author was talking about. I can only foresee the amount of research one must have done through to write this book. I also recommend that this book should be for everyone especially younger minds- trust me- with the help of this understanding there would be less hate in this world. More unity that it would make the politicians to ban this book because this would simply unite us with our differences."
Sapiens,Placeholder,Know your existence,5,Iam too less to say at all about This award winning title. I gifted it to my family! I also have a podcast of it. But nothing could be more relaxing than reading a paperback ( paperback were introduced to south asian community such that we can afford to buy them ) holding in your hand and turning pages! An avid reader.
Sapiens,Raj,The universal truths it contains,5,"This one of most eye-opening books that I ever read. It shows us all the universal truths, though I am 8th grader and comprehending this book was little difficult task for me. But yeah if you read this book, the events will be forever etched into your memory."
Sapiens,Karthick Nagarajan,Must read by Humankind,5,"This is one of the finest book and worth reading, the fascinated one which does made the perfect justice... Author has made his point clear and simple by mentioning all the evidences of evolution of humankind till date, we are believing that we are the present Superpower in this world, which is simply busted by comparing the humankind with wheat, rice, potatoes... The comparison doesn't make a lame excuse to convince the readers about the point of view of author... After reading the comparison, it just rang a different perspective bell in our mind that, might be the comparison is correct or we might start thinking that why we din't thought like that before... The agricultural revolution made human evolution far more suitable for surviving in the past as well as in the future, because concern about the future was rooted not only in seasonal cycles of production, but also in the fundamental uncertainty of agriculture... Consequently, from the advent of agriculture worries about the future become major players in the theatre of the human mind... Human evolution had consequences like foundation of large scale political and social systems... How we are getting Struck inside the prism walls? the actual prism wall is our imagined order... That we have to accept the truth, humankind has developed the imagined order like democracy, religion, god, capitalism etc... hindu caste system and its discriminations we overwhelmed for a period of more 2500 years has been busted just like that... significant answers from the author about the gender inequality and what are all the reasons which makes it live till date... What should be the thought process we should change to come against this kind of discrimination...! Human evolution has gone major break through in the last few centuries... After all the inventions, we came upto nuclear and DNA level of engineering... Still with that, Humankind is not making a change in the livelihood of other Species and for itself... We become the terrorfull destroyer after all this development than like ever before... Industrial Revolution and Commercialisation has ultimately transformed the greeny earth to concrete and Plastic coated earth... - "

Sapiens,ron,History on a Giant Scale,5,"This book is history on a grand scale, as the author attempts to trace out fundamental questions about Homo Sapiens by looking at its Longue dure history. It argues that human history has been fundamentally altered by three big revolutions the Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution and Scientific Revolution. A species strictly in the middle of the animal hierarchy there was nothing to suggest in Sapiens early history that it would become the most dominant species on the planet. Language helped them create social constructs (whether it is of religion, corporations or money), that allowed cooperation on a scale not encoded within their genetic makeup and permitted them to emerge triumphant at the top of the hierarchy. The book discusses in detail the quirks within human beings, and society, which have emerged because of this astounding success. For while fictions have allowed us to cooperate, it has also resulted in the use of coercion to maintain, what different Sapiens at different times have thought to be the natural order (natural order does not need any force to maintain it, for it is natural). Over a truly long period, one of the characteristics of Sapiens society is the formation of increasingly complex mega culture; and money, empires and religion, have been the driving forces behind this consolidation. The book discusses how the agricultural revolution made this complexity possible with the surplus that it produced, allowing larger human populations to exist, while making the life of the majority of human beings significantly worse as said surplus was appropriated by tiny elites, a fact only remedied in recent times. The book discusses in detail so many aspects of human history ranging from inequality, hierarchies, extreme human violence, etc., that it is difficult to wrap your head around it, though Harari writes it in one of the most beautiful and readable prose I have come across, with pages upon pages filled with some nugget of wisdom or insight. Though I do wish he had given more of the sources he used in writing his book so it would be easier to explore them. Otherwise, definitely one of the best books I have ever read."
Sapiens,SushilKumar Sharma,"Gotta say, it kept me hooked from the start",5,"Okay, so I saw this book on a recommendation list when I was searching for books to buy online. Didn't have much doubts, since this book seemed to cover areas related to history, and that too of mankind's, which is my favourite topic to read about. Anything works, as long as it includes historically related factors. So, I started reading it from yesterday when it got delivered (also, another fantastic delivery by Amazon, got the item in perfect and readable condition) and gotta say...I'm certainly in love with it. I think I've got more to figure out about this book but as far as I have read, it is amazing. This might be a bit uncomfortable for christians to read as the book has elements criticizing the religion but...as someone who's an atheist, I didn't give a flying f**k and kept reading on. That's all I have to say. Need to read further to discover the fascinating aspects of this book but I'm already in love with it."
Sapiens,Swati Jaiswal,A must read for anyone who cares about their existence.,5,"Beginning with a record of history, there's almost nothing the book does not touch upon, biology, philosophy, economics, anthropology, sociology, theism, psychology, and one of the biggest questions of the future: where are we heading. An amazing account of thought provoking records of these various domains, this book is for everyone who is willing to take a stab at existence and ideologies of humans currently as they are, who they were and what they might become. I particularly liked the way the author isn't taking any side, the way he is trying to stay on the edge while giving you an opportunity to take a dive. There are concepts we might already be aware of, for them we have opportunity to either question the text or find an affirmation to strengthen some ideas. Then there are concepts we might not be familiar with, it also gives us the opportunity to explore them without biases. But the basic idea is to provoke you to think. It doesn't even ask you to decide or take a stand at last. Just leaves you with open questions that we as a collective can and should think about as to where we want to take our species and how we want to shape the world. Can we without a doubt say that we are that special species, this earth is going round about for? Can we easily ignore other creatures in the name of intelligence or no intelligence. What humanity is, what human rights are for and whom do they benefit other than us and if they are limited to us then how long do we think the natural ecosystem could favour them and let us enjoy the self proclaimed upper class status that we do. While talking about all the so called objective domains, it doesn't leave behind the subjective domain called as 'Happiness'. There's something for almost everyone. But yeah definitely limited overall to the domain of philosophy (atleast as I felt). The tools are factual but the method is philosophical and the output, well is very subjective. But surely makes a case for the uninitiated to atleast get introduced to this vast world of questions that are essential to ask. can't emphasize more, 'Must Read!!'"
Sapiens,Manohar Nayak,Great,5,"Nothing to dislike. You're amazing, amazon."
Sapiens,vishwajeet aher,Why You SHould Read Sapiens,5,"The current Corona pandemic has given us a lot of time to think about nature &amp; how humankind has impacted it. We share planet Earth with so many diverse animal &amp; plant species, but no other species has changed this planet to the extent we humans have. I always wondered why humans? Why us? I got my answers in Sapiens. A brilliantly written masterpiece by Dr Yuval Noah Harari on history of humankind. Dr Harari has very elaborately explained why Homo Sapiens are different. What has propelled this one species from being just another life form to becoming the most dominant biological entity on Earth? Dr Harari says what distinguishes Homo Sapiens from others is our ability to believe in imagined entities. This enables us to cooperate in large groups. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe is rooted in common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination Homo Deus on the other hand talks about future of Homo Sapiens. The future that author has talked about can be a wonder ride, scary, shocking for you depending on how you look at it. If you have already read Sapiens you will feel the Homo Deus being repetitive. Author has devoted significant portion talking about why Homo Sapiens have been successful till now. Most of the key challenges Homo Sapiens faced till 20th century have already been resolved. But will we remain satisfied just because we resolved challenges we have been facing till now? Author says No We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon -Homo Deus If you want to know what we will be up to I strongly recommend Homo Deus to you. I am sure you will be shocked to read all the possibilities that future holds for our kind."
Sapiens,Tito Das,Do yourself a favour. Read this book.,5,"Yuval Noah Harari is one of the finest scholars ever. Sapiens is without doubt, the best Popular Science book ever written. Harari introduces our earth to us from the very beginning. He next deals with the other species preceding the Homo Sapiens. The information he provides are a result of painstaking research and rigorous reading which proves his scholarship. He talks about the Homo Erectus, Homo Habilis, Homo Rudolfensis and Homo Neanderthalis before talking about us, the Homo Sapiens. Through evidence Harari shows that we have been the most dominant species on earth for the last 10,000 years. The book is divided into four sections. Section One begins with the Cognitive Revolution where Harari explains how the human body changed physiologically. The early humans lost a great deal of energy for their complex digestive system. They had to digest large chunks of raw food. Gradually however, we leant to cook our food which helped save energy so that we could do other things. This helped to improve our brains and we became more intelligent as a species. Section Two deals with the Agricultural Revolution as we learnt to harvest and thus produce our own food. We learnt to tame animals for the first time instead of wasting hours chasing after them. Section Three deals with the unification of mankind as we established connections through trade, commerce and conquests. Section Four deals with the Scientific Revolution as man produced the first sophisticated medicines, weaponry, and travel equipments. Do not be put off by the length of the book or by the heavy subjects it deals with. Harari's lucid prose ensures that his readers have a good time. The way he combines information, elucidation, and sheer valuable insight makes this book truly unique and remarkable. This is not just a book on anthropology. Rather it is a book that tackles issues of biology, economics, chemistry, physics, literature, technology and history. It is a whole compendium of knowledge. That is because it deals with human progress through the ages. So naturally Harari has to talk about all the aspects that man has encountered since the beginning of time. I can personally assure you that this is the best non fiction book you'll ever read irrespective of your tastes. I read various books from autobiographies, fiction, fantasy fiction, sports books, love stories to science fiction. Despite my varied tastes this book happens to be one of my favorites. Do yourself a favour. Read this book."
Sapiens,Online Shopper,5 stars,5,"This is one of those rare books which is superbly written, intelligent and mind-altering. I am convinced by this author's arguments and my view of the human condition has changed permanently. I thought this would be a book that would delve lavishly in later human evolution, but it is does not. It discusses it briefly and moves on, concentrating its effort on the times of agricultural revolution and forward. It is a masterpiece of anthropology. 'Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. One the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As times went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as United States and Google.' 'Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persits, the imagined reality exerts force in the world. [...] Most millionaires sincerely believe in the existence of money and limited liability of companies. Most human-rights activists sincerely believe in the existence of human rights.' I have never considered the extent of the imagined reality we all live in before. I have never equated my belief in human rights with the belief in Vishnu, or considered that a corporation too is all in our collective heads. The author moves on through history and gives plenty of new perspectives on events. 'Most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on the condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to their cravings and passions - and buy more and more. This is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do we know that we'll get paradise in return? We've seen it on television.' These are just a few tidbits of insight and perspective. I absolutely loved this book! Highly recommended to anyone curious about the human condition."
Sapiens,A patel,Knowledgeable,5,Useful to know history of mankind. It's good.
Sapiens,Piyush,Original product.,5,Book is original.
Sapiens,Kausar,Book quality ok ok,5,Book quality is just ok. I wish UK or collectors edition was available for purchase. Content of book is just amazing. Evolution is such big mystery. It really questions our current way of living. Never found any non-fictional book so intriguing. 5 stars for content 2 stars for Vintage publishers
Sapiens,Surbhi Islam,!!!A must read!!!,5,"Sapiens', A brief history of humankind is a phenomenal book by Dr. Yuval Noah Harari. I have never been much into non-fiction genre so I was dubious about whether I'd be able to finish this cult book(also a fat one) in near future. But then I read a few pages and kept on going unstoppably. It's an explosion of information from prehistoric era, Cognitive revolution to the Agricultural revolution to the Scientific revolution, uptill now. It is the story of Homo Sapiens, the only surviving human species, skillfully narrated to blow your mind chapter by chapter. It covers almost every important topic from time to time immemorial and explain it to you in myriad ways. From an animal of no importance to a hunter-gatherer to a modern day elite man on the verge of becoming god, humans have fought many battles and came out victorious to achieve supremacy over other species and even the mother nature itself. Nevertheless, we are unable to achieve contentment. We have harnessed so much power but we still have no clue, where to use it, how to use it and on what greater purpose. We are still in an absolute perplexity what we really 'want to want'. I always believed, that we live in the best of times and also in the worst of times and this book confirms that. Harari dexterously delivers what he promises in the blurb with his lucid writing and manages to provoke you to look at your unfulfilling life, your not so comfortable surroundings and the ever changing nature with an all new spectacle. Sometimes, Knowing where we come from makes us humble and we begin to appreciate our life we live in the present time. The cover in all its simplicity grabs your attention even in the stack of hundreds of books."
Sapiens,Unknown,Rise and Rise of Homo Sapiens,5,"Sapiens by Yuval is an outstanding and a well written book how after a humble start of being just another ape, homo sapiens have come to be so dominant and have evolved into the modern society. The story of domination started with the 'cognitive' revolution 10s of thousands of years ago. On the way, the author describes a number of revolutions i.e., agricultural, scientific, industrial and information revolutions. Given the time scale of the history, the trends observed and the consequent lessons are very profound. Some of the things that stood out for me are: 1. Human design i.e., emotions, instincts, desires, eating habits, sexuality, etc has not changed. 2. Ability to support large populations is through the ability to control the external environment/technology -- agriculture, animal husbandry, etc are examples of this. One of the thing that comes out very starkly is the correlation between efficiency in using resources and living standards of people. This is an important public policy question as India grapples with issues like drought. 3. Really wonder if the goals of giving better standard of living to everybody is possible without disturbing the environment at all? Mahabharat in a way settled the issue by telling us that Pandavas had to destroy a forest to build Indraprasth. 4. Human beings have thrived through their ability to co-operate. Money, abstract thought, myths, trade, etc are a manifestation of that. The role of myths in human co-operation -- very interesting is his take on religion beliefs, giving way to the modern myths of liberalism, socialism, etc. And as the author explains how the behaviour of generations was shaped by the myths that they lived with. Wonder, what is the best way for 7 Billion people of increasingly a single community to live together ? 5. Role of empires vs nationalism -- Will nationalism gradually die in a globalising world? 6. Interesting is his take on role of accidents vs deliberate discovery, impact of small incremental changes and its long term impact. All in all a great and a very profound book and recommend to everybody."
Sapiens,Anonymous,History is a wonderful story.,5,Very Good book
Sapiens,MRITYUNJAY RAJA,Fantastic!!!!!!,5,"Fantastic book. It has answered all the questions which we didn't think about it.Although some chapters are boring but most are interesting.However I have seen some Anti hindu elements in this book but It's doesn't matter because knowledge is worth.If you are an average book reader like me then you can complete this book in around 20 days.Dont fear from the number of pages because if you start reading it ,you would see that you have unconsciously completed 50 pages within 45 minutes. Person who have average or some low knowledge of English could also understand this book easily. I wanted coloured book but it contain black and white.Dont buy from CLOUDTAIL if you want color printed.Search for other seller.I thought that CLOUDTAIL will provide coloured edition but it doesn't. However picture doesn't matter , it's only a matter before buying any book and when you buy book this matter exausted from your mind. However the book is worth to buy it. Even it is worth for UPSC preparation especially for interview. Even CAPTION AMERICA had recommended it. I have uploaded some interesting paragraph of this book. Thankyou........"
Sapiens,Mohd Amaan,"A book of history, philosophy, science, politics, and tinch of every other subjects.",5,"This book should be made compulsory in schools and colleges . It tells us about history in the philosophical way more than most history books. This book is a combination of so many topics, so that you connect ,every field, subject to see an overall big picture of the world and the human society."
Sapiens,Piyush PY,Amazing book,5,Highly recommended for people who are interested in history and philosophy. This book will give you new point of view to seeing the world.

Sapiens,Nelson,Sapiens - Book review,5,"Its not a small book from Yuval Noah Harari, consisting of 466 pages; I would call it a medium size book. The language the author uses is very lucid and flows into stories. From one story to another, we don't get tired comprehending the ideas the author wants us to digest as it is written in an interesting way in a free flowing lucid language. Although most of the book is interesting and you tend to want to read more and more getting gripped by newer stories, I found the book a little tiring in some chapters in which I had no intrinsic interest, but if you conquer those hurdles than this book is a cake to complete. Its a good book to know the history of humans from the perspective of finding out why we are the way we are (how the modern world works the way it is currently).If you are curious to question the nuances of our modern life, a lot of those questions would be answered or make you to think in those directions to find out why things are the way they are. It would also make you ponder over questions like, what is the meaning of life? what is happiness and what to expect from future of sapiens based on past experiences. This book covers from the lives of the earliest homo sapiens about 70,000 years ago to the agricultural revolution, to the cognitive revolution, to the pre-modern industrial revolution, to the industrial revolution. Finally it covers the last 200 years of mans history and the opportunities for the future with genetic engineering, AI and machine learning. Overall this book is a must read for the ones who have questions about human evolution in terms of societal changes. This book helps us to know ourselves better and question the basic assumptions of our modern day living."
Sapiens,Pratyasha Acharya,"Intersection of Biology, History & Social Sciences - Book Review",5,"I have a funny story with this one. I had ordered this book and product back in 2018, and it had arrived in perfect condition, so thanks as usual Amazon! :) However, I have only started reading it now, thanks to COVID-19. So let me get to the book review part - Reading this brilliant gem of a book 'Sapiens' is probably one of the many great events of my life. The hype is worth it. This book challenges everything we know, plus gives us a crash course on Anthropology, sociology, Gender Studies and everything else under the sun. The author does a wonderful job of transitioning from each phase of human history, starting from the 'hunter-gatherer' age, 'agricultural revolution', 'cognitive revolution' etc. till the birth of concepts like 'human rights', 'religion', 'empires', etc. He very skillfully forces us to think hard about each phase and backs his stories with solid research. Never before has history seemed so amazing! I was not a very strong non-fiction reader, but this book is by far one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read! I particularly found the intersection between sociology, history and science very interesting. What a master story teller, Yuval Noah Harari! Loved it."
Sapiens,kranthi kiran,One perspective of the world,5,"There are many ways to look into our past. This book provides one perspective that relaxes you. A very good example is colonialism. If we look at the Indian anger of British colonizing Indian sub-continent we may feel the British looted India. But if we look back before the British came there is no such thing called India. Several Kingdoms existed and the whole Indian History is like one kingdom taking over the other one plundering the other s wealth or bringing their ideology over the others. People of different groups and races invaded India and lost over the course of time, Britain/East India Company is one such thing. This is just one side of the coin. Because it just talks about one human group making colonies of the the other human group. But looking even backwards in time even before the British or even before the Ancient Indian Civilizations or other world civilizations India or any landmass is occupies a wide spectrum living species. The native species are not humans rather all kinds of flora and fauna. But when first Indian settlers came the species lost in the timeline. Like how European Settlers did to the native Americans or native Australians , the same Natives did to the inhabiting species of plants and Animals when they first set foot. But today when see one human group acting violently on another human group it should not be of any surprise because the same sufferers did the same thing they experienced to the inhabiting species plants and animals. It is surprise because we are the species who dominate the earth and this gives us an illusion that earth is a planet made for humans. But if we look back into our past we know that we are not the only species and also not the only human species on the earth. Why we are today the way we are ?"
Sapiens,Vikash Agarwal,An eye opener,5,This books dives deep into human history &amp; talks about the human race collectively. It tries to answer lot of questions on why we are what we are today. It changes our perspective towards many things in life. It gives an holistic view on life in general
Sapiens,Sahil,Unique and though provoking.,5,"I have special interest in History as i love it as subject. I have read many history books not only modern but also ancient or books on prehistory. But after reading Homosapiens i am just overwhelmed that how the author has presented evolution of human history in such a simplistic , unique and analytical manner. This book not only details anthropological evidences or facts but it covers all scenarios to present the picture whether it is biology, genetics, culture, science , environment etc. I loved the way the author covered the issue and aspects of religion in human history from early man till today. How and why religion evolved , and how religion is directly related to political and economic power. This book will help you in critical analysis of what we are fed or what we study. This book will force you to form your opinion based on facts and logic rather than some religion or superstitions. Some of the best chapters in the book are: 1 History biggest fraud 2 There is no justice in history 3 The law of religion 4 The marriage of Science and Empires 5 The End of Homosapiens. This book is must read for not only student of history but for all those who are curious enough to understand the concept of how human history evolved.

Sapiens,Shilpi Kheria,It could be one of the most profound book you will ever read !,5,"This book is not a history book ! It's like a gospel for people who are unable to make sense of the actual gospel et al ! It explains how the world works and why it works the way it does in a beautiful form of a STORY ! This book is not to be read like a textbook or something like a to do list or even something like a book to be discussed with people as a show of intellect ! Read it slowly and try to imagine and absorb what the author is trying to convey ! It might truly tweak on how you see the world and perhaps how you live your life ! How you shape your priorities ! (Read it again if you didn't feel what I just wrote) For people who are believers(religion), read it with patience without blasting off at the author for being a blatant atheist, even if it's conflicting a lot; just try to ignore the part where you think it contradicts your belief and just go for the remaining at least !"

Sapiens,Ravneet Kaur,Sapiens- a book review,5,"SAPIENS by Yuval Noah Harari is one of the most important books of the 21st century. It is an eye opener and as informative as it can get. Harari has literally compiled all the information about our planet and our species and put it in this book. It tells us of the reason why the world that we live in today is the way it is. This book is very informative and important and cannot be described as a casual read. I am a quick reader. I can finish a book in a few hours or a day or two, but this book has literally taken me weeks to finish. And I dont think it is a bad thing at all. It just contains so much information and has so much to tell that I needed time to process all that I was reading about. I would literally stop after a certain topic so I could think about it and process it all and then pick up the book again. No book, and I mean no book at all, can come up to this level of importance on the must-read scale. It is very important for us to read this book and understand the way that we as humans have evolved in every way since existing on this planet and the consequences of our decisions on other humans, beings and most importantly, this planet."

Sapiens,Kindle Customer,If you wanna read a single book to know mankind this it,5,I have been suggested this book by saying 'it'll change your perspective about the world how you see it' damn hats off to that person. It really did. Compiling whole journey of mankind from beginning of this universe to till date in a single book for me is next to impossible but Mr harari did it.
Sapiens,Sagar Shah,Must read for all Homo Sapiens. Period.,5,"Very few authors can make you fall in love with the dullest and boring topics like history. Dan Brown is one of them. He made us feel that the subject of religion can be interesting and exciting. Harari does the same to the subject of human history. Sapiens is a brilliant, provocative, and well-researched book about human evolution. It is a thrilling account of how we transformed from insignificant apes to rulers of the world. For instance, what if you were told that we (Homo Sapiens) were not the only species that lived on this planet? That we were responsible for driving the extinction of planets most plant and animal species. That the Agricultural Revolution was the historys biggest fraud and a trap. That the concept of god, religion, nation, school, and money is all fiction and only in our imaginations. That empire, religion, and money were the three biggest reasons for the unification of humankind. That in this modern era, humankind for the first time faces the possibility of annihilation. Homo Sapiens in Latin means Wise Man. This is a perfect book to read and become Homo Sapiens. I feel the book should be made mandatory reading in schools and colleges. If you have even a little bit of interest in any of the above then Ill say go for it. In fact, just read it. Don't think twice. Don't judge the book by its cover. Order it. Thank me later. :-)"
Sapiens,arunkumar,It's a concise yet crisp history of human work,5,"It's rather a concise yet crisp history of humankind.You will learn a lot of things,the author might seem assertive at times,but that will make the read interesting,nevertheless,he tries to bring about the established evidences and also our inability to find conclusions about prehistoric times because of our insufficiency of evidences from sapiens' life before tens of thousands of years ago. The later part of the book will shoot a lot of questions at us,which makes it even more exhilarating,followed by the scientific revolution part. It doesn't explain everything briefly,you cant expect everything to be briefly presented here,its not the goal of this book. Its really tough to give engaging insights into so many domains that existed in our past,the truth is it's really hard to do everything the author did in a single book of 500 pages.There is so much to appreciate about this work once you read it,it may even open up your doors for further interests,so it's also a good starter."
Sapiens,Muthu,Thought provoking !!,5,This is one of the books that really immerses you into the evolution of beings coupled with history and provokes you into thinking what we could become in future .

Sapiens,giriprashath,THE MYSTERY UNRAVELED!!!,5,"Have you ever been on a trip to the life of the foragers? If not buy this ticket and hop on. the Author takes you on ride to the mystic truth of the chaotic creatures that evolved to almost challenge the spirit of mother nature. I am sure that you will have an awe till the last word.this book brings all the spiritual beliefs as science. this book clearly explains why the other humans the Apes, Neandarthals or the erectus species were unable to be in the position, where we are now.this book is a serious Rationalist.there is a reason behind every single silly thing. for example : there is a reason for fire being worshiped as god. Because using fire people cooked food. the two organs which consumed a lot of energy were brains and intestines.as cooked food reduced the energy utilized by intestines, that energy flowed to the brains.that made the brain grow. eventually the size of the head of sapiens. as the female cant give birth to large headed creatures babies were born premature.that is why puppies can walk within a week and it takes almost a year for babies to walk.so anything can be taught to these ignorant babies and that is why we are here on the top. this is in just a single page and every single page has lot of these rationalist thoughts.explore the remaining for yourself. just go for it."
Sapiens,Anusha,Entire human Evolution in one book,5,"This book beautifully chronicles from the time humans were hunters and gatherer to modern times. The 70000 years evolution of human species is captured in an interesting and plausible manner which made reading this book, an intellectually stimulating exercise. Author Yuval Noah Harari is no doubt one of the brilliant minds who could elucidate even complex matters in a simple way with examples. The traces human history from cognitive revolution, some 70000 years ago, where Homo sapiens experienced gene mutation which made them an intellectually and socially superior species who inturn deciminated other species and more importantly for last 10000 years Homo sapiens is the only sole survivor in Homo family. The cognitive revolution was followed by agriculture revolution paving ways for permanent settlement and domestication of crops and farm animals. Thus evolution wheel sets in motion crossing myriads of events - invention of money, imaginary social order, empire, religion, imperialism, breakthrough scientific revolution transforming and shaping our social, political, economic, technological system as it stands today. The author also extrapolate years forward, which looks eminent given the advancement in genetic engineering and nano technology."
Sapiens,mani,A Gift to hubby,5,Bought it for my husband. He is not much into reading but he loved this one. Soo happy with my purchase.
Sapiens,Atulya Sinha,READ HOMO DEUS INSTEAD,4,"I tend to think of this book as a prequel to Homo Deus, simply because I happened to read them in the wrong order! In fact, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind was written several years before Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow. Yuval Noah Harari, the author, is a professor of History and an intellectual polymath in the tradition of Bronowski, Issac Asimov and Carl Sagan. He has written several path-breaking books during the past ten years. This book is a sweeping dissertation on the history of mankind. On the very first page, we are told about the conceptual sequence of physics, chemistry, biology and history. Next, the author lists the three revolutions which have shaped the course of history: The Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution and the Scientific Revolution. The book is divided into four sections, one for each of the three Revolutions and one serving as a bridge between the Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Let us examine these sections one by one. The section on the Cognitive Revolution begins with a disturbing secret for a long time, Homo Sapiens was not the only human species. In the authors own words, The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different species of man. The author says that more than one human species had learnt the use of fire. Homo Sapiens originated in East Africa and entered Eurasia through the Arabian Peninsula about 70,000 years ago. There are two conflicting theories about the interaction between Sapiens and the other species, known as the Interbreeding Theory and the Replacement Theory. The author speculates that the truth lies in between these two theories, although there is a strong likelihood that violence and genocide had occurred, as Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. The Cognitive Revolution comprises new ways of thinking and communicating, which arose between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago. Sapiens bonded with gossip and formed bands with upto 150 members. Beyond this limit, says the author, human cooperation becomes possible only through common myths, or imagined reality, leading to trade and cultural evolution. Further, The wandering bands of storytelling Sapiens were the most important and most destructive force the animal kingdom had ever produced The settlers of Australia, or more accurately, its conquerors, didnt just adapt, they transformed the Australian ecosystem beyond recognition. The combination of climate change and human hunting changed not only Australia, but also Siberia, North America and South America. Coming to the next Revolution, agriculture began around 9500 8500 BC in south eastern Turkey, and simultaneously in other parts of the globe as well. The author surprisingly describes Agriculture as historys biggest fraud and justifies it by saying that the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. As the population increased and animals were domesticated, the possibility of returning to a foraging lifestyle diminished. Rearing of animals involved (and still involves) extreme cruelty. Eventually, as trade began and data arose, some rudimentary forms of writing began. Next, hierarchies came up based on imagined orders. Simultaneously, gender discrimination arose in various societies. The third section of the book is titled Unification of Mankind, which covers human culture. The author identifies three universal orders: economic, or the monetary order; political, or the imperial order; and finally, religious order exemplified by religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. There are detailed chapters on each of these. The fourth and last section of the book covers the Scientific Revolution. Beginning with the philosophical aspects of ignorance and the scientific temperament, the author presents another striking line of thought: The feedback loop between science, empire and capital has arguably been historys chief engine for the past 500 years. The next few chapters are devoted to these topics. Subsequently, the author discusses the Industrial Revolution, along with energy, mass production and the social impact of technology. This is followed by a chapter focusing on the relationship between prosperity and happiness, followed by some speculations about the future. There can be no doubt that this book is a tour de force, which compels the reader to think. However, various criticisms can be levelled against Dr Harari. The foremost of these is that many speculations, theories and opinions of the author are presented as established facts. The other major potential for criticism lies in the selection of material and the relative emphasis on various topics. This reviewer, for example, feels that most of the chapters in the third and fourth sections of the book are too long and verbose. I cannot end this review without comparing this book with the authors subsequent work Homo Deus, which I happened to read first. There is considerable overlap between the topics covered in the two books. The speculations about the past in this book are mirrored by speculations about the future in the other book. But there is an important difference: while this book leaves the reader with a sense of shame for belonging to Homo Sapiens, the other one gives hope that someday there will be a sense of pride arising out of being human. Finally, if one had to choose to read only one of these two books, I would unequivocally recommend Homo Deus."
Sapiens,Umesh K.,inglorious case study of human journey,4,The narrative in book of human as they lived clearly shows that sapiens vision has always been myopic. It was alway propelled by selfish motives without prudence. The course it has taken were often at the cost of ecosystem. The damage sapiens have done is visible to them only when harm is manifested subsequently and there are very little chance to reverse them. Overall it is brilliant rendition by Yuval who is will continue to follow.
Sapiens,ravi kant,Good,4,Good
Sapiens,Dr Maitreyee Joshi,Sapiens - The march through millenniums,4,"SAPIENS I have been reading SAPIENS by Yuval Noah Harari and it does give you a feel of watching a long documentary of the march of Sapiens on the planet through millenia, on a huge screen. According to the book we know about human evolution only from the last 70,000 years when the cognitive revolution started. It was the hunter gatherer stage of the sapiens. Here the author clarifies a very important misconception that we, the sapiens are unique, and that there is and was no other species like us. He says that the continents separated by oceans were inhabited by different human species either at the same time or different times. Just as monkeys have many species, humans had many different species, like the neanderthals and homo erectus. Just as there is no possibility of mating between monkeys of different species so was the case with different human species.&nbsp; But Sapiens were by far the most destructive kind of humans and wherever they travelled, they destroyed other human species, jungles, and wild animals for their benefit. Neanderthals became extinct in the same way.&nbsp; Rather, the whole human evolution and history which passes from Cognitive revolution through agricultural revolution, industrial revolution and scientific revolution, is a story of human progress, but also has a backstory of large scale massacre, genocide and destruction.&nbsp; Agricultural revolution led to the gaining a partial control of availability of food and creation of villages and cities but destroyed the jungles. Taming of animals led to communicable diseases. Agriculture also made sapiens lose their freedom over their time which was plenty with the hunter gatherers. It started the exploitation of the cattle and poultry animals like never before. Industrial revolution led to slavery and large scale destruction of agriculture land. Industrial revolution exploited the natural resources and there was always an insecurity of exhausting them, but until today sapiens have become successful in discovering novel resources to fuel the industrial revolution, to the extent that now most of us believe that they are inexhaustible. &nbsp;Capitalism which ran hand in hand with the industrial revolution, initially stood on the back of slave trade. It gave rise to some unfair capitalists who exploit their employees. Capitalism believes in the credit system and dreams of the future, but if the future does not deliver goods, the capitalist bubble does not take long to burst just like the 2007 US economic slowdown when the housing bubble burst. Science taught sapiens to realize and say that they do not know the answers to many things in their quest for a better life. Scientific thinking constantly challenges religious dogmas but all of our inventions and discoveries march ahead only after they have crushed those on whom the experiments were carried out as in testing medicines on lab animals. Today the scientific revolution has reached a place where sapiens are experimenting on transferring thoughts to bionic limbs, to creating genetically superior species of plants and animals, to developing AI having abilities superior to sapiens themselves. These discoveries and inventions are fraught with moral and ethical dilemmas. We have not yet lost our faith in reaching that place in history when everyone will be comfortable and we would have created heaven here itself on planet earth. Capitalists say, it's just around the corner. But is it? Today we are living in the era of peace and luxury like never before. There was no time in history when the planet was so less fraught with wars. Nuclear bombs are a double edged sword. Their existence holds such a huge threat to&nbsp; human existence that no country chooses war over other measures of achieving self- interest. There are a few skirmishes here and there, but not the way the planet was ravaged with wars before the second world war. Those wars, religious or otherwise were so ubiquitous that they wiped out humongous other micro cultures and tribes. Wiping or destroying others for self interest has been as old as the cognitive revolution. On the other hand sapiens are trying to discover ways and means of lasting happiness and the meaning of its own existence. Most of the time, new discoveries about human happiness match with the texts which the old philosophers and saints have written eons back, but there is a sense of satisfaction in finding the match between the new and the old. Finally, scientifically and objectively human life has no meaning. It started as bacteria and viruses, which had no consciousness and aim or ambition. Evolution of sapiens just was an accident in the evolution of life. Meaning to the life of sapiens is what they give. So better let it be a well thought of because we are just about to start playing God."
Sapiens,madhura,Amazing Book,4,"Though I found it a little hard to complete the entire book, It was fun to read. The language was surprisingly easy to understand. Hope this helps!"
Sapiens,jiten gandhi,Book print review,4,Book text is small makes it difficult to read fast also some pages are not aligned. Same comments for other books except ' Compound effect' which is fun for readers

Sapiens,Vyoma Hadkar,"Finally I read this, and it opened my eyes.",4,"Hello everyone. I just completed this yesterday and felt that everyone should really read about the evolution. Yuval gives a brilliant perspective on how we evolved, conquered seas, established empires, troubled natives of the lands and how we got truly domesticated by a plant called wheat. Today, the animals and birds are reclaiming their lands and air if you may...if you read this book you will think this is finally justice to how we have behaved with the world. In the end, Yuval boils down to something very basic - Contentment and happiness that Buddha preached. He also talks about how the world is heading to a crazy future of nonsensical projects in the name of medicine and saving peoples lives. The book was released in 2011 and now more than ever people are reading it. Coincidence? I think not. As a collective consciousness we are driven to this book because it helps us understand the mistakes we made and perhaps how we can better them. It was only last year we saw the Polar Bear in the Nat Geo feed looking bony and starved because the melting of the arctic ice...it was the most abnormal thing to have witnessed. Also, it was just last year Greta Thunberg gave a soul stirring speech at the UN which went viral. Why did it go viral? Because the consciousness that we all have is a single one. Her outburst was us crying inside for what we are doing to this world. We can learn now, make a difference now...we have plenty of time to think and internalise. Why buy plastic when we can buy stainless steel, plastic making companies can start alternate environment friendly production of items. Look at us in the lockdown! Are we even using any of the fancy stuff we bought and paid for with big money. We are surviving on essentials. We aren't really complaining. We are hoping that after this lockdown we can meet our friends and family and just give them a hugLet's start small, let's relook at how we buy and how people do business, maybe then we can still have this world to enjoy and convince God that we truly deserve this world. #happyreading #lockdownreading #eyeopening #sapiens"
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,This book is a must read to generate inquisitiveness within,4,"The book has a very catchy start with a brief talk about the Big Bang. After shortly explaining the physics and chemistry of life coming into existence on planet earth, it narrows down towards the single topic Sapiens. Thereafter, all the chapters and topics talk about Homo Sapiens. This book is a journey about Homo-Sapiens becoming the most dominant and to-be-scared-from species on Earth. Harari has penned down all his knowledge on this area in a way which I would like to call smartly subtle, where he has left the readers to think. My personal favourite is the chapter on Agricultural Revolution, explaining how humankind became slave to their food (wheat) you will feel a sense of tension mixed with humour while reading it! Apart from this, there are some areas on which readers views might differ totally. My personal view is different about whenever the book talks about Aryan Invasion. As per my view, Aryan Invasion is a cooked-up story and the book seems to be supporting it. The most questioning area for me: As discussed with some of my professors, the Mahabharata war happened some 5000 years ago, of which this book has no mention at all. This leaves my mind in a highly puzzled state when did Mahabharata war actually happen? Did it happen or not? If it did, how can such a massive event go unnoticed by the writer? How does this fit in together? This doesnt make sense at all!! Is there a parallel universe where Mahabharata happened, which has its own history? Wallah!! This is where the book has increased my inquisitiveness manifold. Coming to the most calming topic the book talks about: Chemical Happiness. Harari has brilliantly explained how Biologists understand happiness, which is nothing but the level of three hormones in our body serotonin, oxytocin and dopamine!! This biological logic behind happiness takes away the earnestness from so-called wise words and quotes - motivation, feel good, be happy, live life to the fullest. Logical happiness has become my new cool these days! In a nutshell, I loved the way Harari has compiled the facts from around the world and bonded them in this book. He has not put up his opinion anywhere, rather, he has just told us what he knows, leaving us open to think and to accept or not accept. I would say, this book is a must read to generate inquisitiveness within and to go crazy SAPIENS! - One of the Sapiens on Planet Earth!"
Sapiens,Surya,"Read with Caution , Think for yourself",4,"This book changed the course of my life . Despite its oversimplifications , controversial extrapolations and wrong presumptions about biological concepts and debatable political opinions , it questions our basic beliefs about the world , the people and about ourselves. As a high school student especially in India where such thoughts are frowned upon and considered blasphemous , where entire lives of people are entrenched in propaganda and superstitions , I am deeply grateful to Yuval Sir for such lucid writing and easy to understand examples to think for ourselves. We have to move on from religious dogmatism , especially in India ."
Sapiens,Books Charming,Nice One.,4,"About 13.5 billion years ago, matter, energy, time and space came into being what is known as the Bing Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics. About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules, and their interactions is called chemistry. About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called biology. About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. The author tells about three important revolutions that shaped the course of history: the Cognitive Revolution started about 70,000 years ago. The Agriculture Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which got underway only 500 years ago. This book tells the story of how these three revolutions have affected humans and their fellow organisms. It's an excellent book with all the facts and figures which we don't know. This book is thought-provoking and changes one's thoughts about history. The author tries to sum up as much as he can in this book but in my opinion, a single book is not enough for the brief history of humankind. It never will be. Although, the book is filled with the author's opinions. He believes that Earth is better off without humans. Some part of the book is very intriguing and some are so boring that you wish to stop reading. There is a lack of information about Neanderthals which made me unsatisfied. I like the scientific revolution part very much. This book tells how we evolve and about our genes and other interesting stuff. It's a must-read. This is the thrilling account of our extraordinary history - from insignificant apes to rulers of the world in which fire gave us power, gossip helped us cooperate, agriculture made us hungry for more, mythology maintained law and order, money gave us something we can really trust, contradictions created culture and science made us deadly."
Sapiens,Alriktimo,What's most important to know?,4,"Take it slow. If you are going to want to understand and find this book helpful then have an open mind it's not just with this book but especially books such as these that give meaning to human existence and challenge certain ideologies by getting and understanding them at their core. Let me put it in simple words. This book can change your life and make you question things at their core(not everyone) to understand and put them in the proper perspective. The subjective reality that we live in(inside our very own brains) and the notion of fighting for it makes no sense beyond our beliefs and the change it's going to bring to our objective reality, of course, that doesn't mean that you have to kill your beliefs and do whatever you like. That's not real life, is it? It's really odd when we go deep, we can't try and catch on to something there because it's mostly empty or at least we don't see it yet. This book brought me some deep-rooted pain. Aware! People who are swinging their moods by questioning whether a supernatural creator exist can get a real kick in the head there so take it slow!"
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Very informative and broadens understanding,4,"I loved every page of this book. By giving an account of the macro perspective, this book humbles us by showing us where we stand in the grand scheme of things. It also shows us how factors, we might not have thought of in our dizziest dreams, shape as deeply as individuals. It has broadened my vision and made me more sensitive to my limitations and habits, in the very process helping me be more flexible yet accepting of certain other things as they are. So many things over centuries of history make us who we are physically, psychologically and socially. Yet some pages also show there is hope to transcend all and not be limited by worldly evolution in every way."
Sapiens,Kiran Elkunchwar,Amazing Read,4,The book is descriptive and educative. Sometimes it feels boring at times and few topics have been explained in more words than needed. Overall the book is informative and insightful.
Sapiens,Ajit Sunder,Marvellous,4,"It was just marvellous to see the journey of Apes,beyond their own imagination too.Great work by Mr Harari in summarising those TURNING POINTS"
Sapiens,Gangadharan K,A very good book for a student of evolution of man.,4,I found it very helpful for me to understand the process of evolution of man.
Sapiens,Saleem Khan,Sapiens....a very different perspective,4,"Last week, I finished reading the book 'Sapiens.....' by Yuval Noah Harari. Trust me, this is one of the finest books I've ever read (and I have read quite a few!). I won't spoil the fun by disclosing everything but let me only share some amazing insights provided by the author (which he backs up with solid arguments and real evidence): Homo Sapiens were only one of many 'Human' species; the life of Homo Sapiens post Agricultural Revolution was worse than it was during the hunter-gatherer stage; More atrocities are committed on animals in the name of animal husbandry and commerical farming than in circuses; The explosion of economy began only once money was invented; Nation, Religion and Corporate are imagined constructs in order to make large numbers of people to think alike, co-operate and collaborate (against their true nature) and the most radical of all - that different religions are not so different after all and, in fact, lie along a continuum with elements of animism, polytheism, monotheism and dual power centre present in all of those. Grab this book and enjoy."
Sapiens,TEJA KOONATI,nice book on human history in brief .,4,"author explains the human history from before the homosapiens existing to and explain spread of homosapiens from south of africa to europe , asia, and to austrila and agriculture revolution and industrial revolution and domination of europian imperialism and spread of capitalism to entire world and lastly explains scientific revolution"
Sapiens,p srivastava,A good summary of human evolution,4,"A good read, at times you might disagree with the author on some points but there are other places where you can completely relate to."
Sapiens,Abhishek,Original and Perfect,4,Book is genuine copy. Go for it!
Sapiens,Siddharth shankaran,"Lucid writing, and certainly makes one think!",4,"I resisted the popular culture and avoided this book for a long while as I am suspicious of popular science/narratives. However Yuvals book certainly deserves a read. He says things as they are in a straightforward manner. Of course a whole of narrative is based on hypothesis projected as confirmed truths, Yuval however stops short of being completely pedantic and leaves gaps for readers to fill in. The risk however is to take it as a bible of sorts, as many will do.(although Yuvals narratives themselves warn against such simplified thought process."
Sapiens,Varun,Thought provoking non fic read,4,"It's not easy for a book to change a reader's well-established conventions, question his or her preconceived notions of reality and at the same time make complete sense. Sapiens is one of those books which challenges you to think about the meta-models which run this world and which have shaped us from the animals we were to the complex societies we are today. The book has several theories, with some evidence, around our evolution from multiple species into a single one, and then about how the era of kingdoms transformed into our modern-day society. But I would like to touch upon one of these theories which I could strongly connect to. Approaching the societal construct from the biological angle the author argues that concepts such as God, Laws, and Money are powerful in aligning societies but they don't mean anything from biology's perspective. That's why they are just false constructs but it's important to realize that these are the constructs that run the world today. And our strong faith in these constructs is what separates Sapiens as a species from most others on the planet. If you enjoy thought-provoking non-fiction do give this book a read!"
Sapiens,Monika,Quality,4,Book packing is good and pages are very nice. Content is most important and easily understood language
Sapiens,Alok Singh,"Wider scope than Guns, Germs and Steel",4,"This is a book by an observer of humanity. His primary expertise seems to be historical rather than scientific or technical which makes for interesting reading. Since the history of science and technology is an area I am reasonably familiar with, I could see his simplifications and para-phrasing. In almost every instance it took nothing away from the discussion. The historical aspect of the book was absolutely fascinating but I wonder if someone who is familiar with many of the incidents and developments, from primary sources would see the simplifications and paraphrasing in the historical aspect as I could see it in the history of science. There were a couple of incidences in the book, for example, the bit about Big Ben's chimes being played live on BBC during WW2 and the Germans' deriving weather information from spectral analysis. Even on the face of things, it seems implausible and I could not find any supporting records for this anywhere online. Perhaps it is a copyright canary or something? A complaint about the Kindle edition is that the typesetting is abysmal. The pictures are tiny and grainy, in the wrong position sometimes."
Sapiens,Placeholder,Superb Book!! but lacking greyness (a bit too much black and white),4,"Sapiens by Harari is a wonderful book. Very interesting and nicely articulate. He chronologically puts in the development of Homo-sapiens through evolution, history and to the present. He elaborates superbly on the Cognitive revolution, Agricultural revolution and onwards. He tries to answer and then lets remain unanswered the prominence of the male gender. His elaboration of 'imagined reality' and how it is maintained is beautiful. Imagined reality is what we live with and yet don't see!! .Superb!! Then why 4 stars instead of 5? While reading, it often comes out that Harari is viewing many things too simplistically and not putting in the effort to elaborate on many points. He often puts forth conclusions based on extremely small samples (albeit interesting) and one sided viewpoints. Then without other input takes them to be the sole deciding criteria. I agree that too much greyness and elaboration would have made this book dense and possibly inconclusive... thereby rendering it to a section of literature that is NOT for the 'black and whilte' demanding general public. But then again a too simplistic view can be a bit off putting (hence a 4 star review)"
Sapiens,Priyam Mondal,Must read,4,got this in right condition and original copy...cocoblu retailers never disappoints me
Sapiens,Shashwat Shrivastava,A Gem of a Book.,4,"It was an excellent read. Though, I didn't like some thoughts of the writer. Specially his point of view about the god. Harari is an atheist, but what a great knowledge he has. An exceptional book it is. Must read."
Sapiens,Manas More,Very awesome book written in easy language.,4,It is just very awesome book . I came to know about many things about which i was unaware. Perfect book for one who wants to study history of human beings
Sapiens,Amit Purohit,Good quality cover and pages,4,You will get to know why we sapiens do the things we do today. Everyday you'll get something new to learn. Everyone must read it. Good quality cover and pages.
Sapiens,Rakesh S,"Here, we are reading our history.",4,"This is about homo sapiens. The only living human tribe. This is about Us. It is always interesting to learn our history. How we got transformed from ancient foragers to present day humans. Obviously that transformation was not smooth, may be not intentional as well. It was a continuous process, evolution. We can say, it is still happening. Who knows, what will be the changes happening to human race after 1000 or 5000 years. Sapiens is all about the evolution process of species homo sapiens. Role of cognitive, agricultural, industrial and scientific revolutions on it. Major achievements and pitfalls of those processes. The interesting part is that author got connected the points in our history using his perspectives. Readers have complete freedom for accepting or not. But it is worth reading."
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,A Brief overview of HumanKind with hint of opinions,4,"I like the book as it gives a birds eye view of human history and How it has impacted other life forms in our planet. The concept of cognitive revolution and associated events were mind boggling where few things appear to be mere speculations. Overall it's a good read, I don't regret investing my time in it."
Sapiens,Sam,Fake Book Alert,4,"The first book I received was a fake/pirated one with cheap cover, dull grey paper with worst printing. I wasn't even able to identify the pictures on the book. So I returned it and again bought from a different seller with good ratings and recieved the original clean and excellent quality book. So my advice before buying books online is to look for sellers with good ratings otherwise you may end up getting pirated ones. And to check authenticity of this book check the quality of the printed pictures and look for the red coloured underside of the cover with reviews. If you still get a fake copy then just write something permanent on the book so that the seller can't sell that again..."
Sapiens,shashank,Good one,4,Further... since the author deals in history there would be lots of places where you would disagree with his perspective. He is enamoured with Europe as the harbinger of modern wisdom. I personally disagree. And lots of other tid bits where he makes sweeping assumptions. Net net a racy read where you dont need to go through each word but will still get the essential idea of what the author is trying to say. But a good summation of the history of mankind. Of course no book can be a compendium of mankind. But it does add a page to your understanding. Or shall I say a paragraph.
Sapiens,Agrani,Interesting,4,Written in very simple language
Sapiens,Akshata,How to know if yours is a Genuine copy,4,"After replacing the pirated book several times on flipkart and snapdeal, I finally got an original copy on amazon. Uread store 4/5 . Didnt receive it in the best condition but Im happy. There were bends and a stain on the pages and cover had a few defects. If you want to know if your copy is original, look for the name popped up on the cover and when light falls on it, it should glaze( check the photo Ive attached) the backside should have complete details about publisher, price tag and red coloured front page. 498pages. 400-425rupees"
Sapiens,chaitanya bhargav,40%fact and the remaing..,4,"Came to know abt this one from a friend of mine..searched abt the same on internet and speaking genuinly after reading few chapters of the book I am just wondering if Yuval Noah Harari could be racist? Reading his thought through his writing, seems he like to identified himself or middle east where he from as decendent of neanderthal which is tread to caucasian ethnicity, potreted as smart, muscular, supreme species other than erectus and devonian. And im agree with the other reviewers. It is 40% fact and 60% author owns idea and interpretation. AND AT LAST AS USUAL AS EVERYTIME..AMAZING DELIVERY EXPERIENCE FROM AMAZON.."
Sapiens,Ruchi Verma,A Recommended read for all!,4,"It is a non-fiction, factual read of the evolution of man throughout aeons. Content is enticing for any person who likes to know more about evolution journey of the man's psyche (which is thinks is very objectively written in the book in most parts at the very least!) The book touches all bases (psycho-sociological perspective) when it comes to the mankind and that is one thing which sets it apart from other written accounts of historical civilizational changes. Having lived in Israel for an year of my study I can relate his writing to Ari Shavit (My promise Land author), in terms of holistic writing which makes it a satisfying read!"
Sapiens,SRINIVASARAJU,Excellent book. But it's very straight forward( my be few writers opinions),4,It's a nice one. You clearly see he has shown very harsh facts of the past. But I think the writer has shows bias to things he dislikes and project it very bad. But don't mistake this with. Content of the book it has very rich content. And this is a one of its own kind of book. But somewhere you can feel the bias towards few. I think trying to project the really as it is. He some how made this mistake mainly at the end ( may be preaching to practice a particular way towards happiness). Never the less just go for it.
Sapiens,san,A must buy for an inquisitive fellow,4,"After having left the reading habit for few years, I restarted with this book. This book, perhaps is the most interesting book you can come across as a amateur history/anthropology enthusiast. Harari kept the book in a very lucid manner which tells his ability to put most complex things pretty simple. He outsmarts Jared diamond (Guns, germs and steel) in this aspect. I can write an elaborate review about this whole book, but let me save your time and mine. New english book reader? Go for it. Anthropology enthusiast? go for it. Looking for a thought provoking book ? Go for it. Wanna be someone who dictates people in a booze party about civilization ? Go for it. It's worth your money time and your intelligence."
Sapiens,Rahul,Great book if you are interested in mankind history.,4,There always be limits when its comes to real history knowledge so does this book dispite these facts in mind the book do have decent information.
Sapiens,Tirtharaj,May be in my locality amazon's packaging is not good. You may not face the same.,4,"Some corners of the book is damaged and there are some wrinkles in the cover here and there. But the book is too good. May be if the book would come with hard bord packaging, this would not be the case. Again I am saying this may not happen with you, you may go with the book."
Sapiens,Manju sjngh,Interesting,4,If you are interested in your species past present and future you might find it in this book
Sapiens,Priya,Evolution and history with a sense of humour!,4,"I have read this I think for the 2nd time over. I read some chapters 4-5 times. My favourite was up until agricultural revolution. After that it starts to become a bit more familiar and what you may have already read many times before. Yet, this is the only book on such a heavy subject that made me laugh and chuckle throughout! My least favourite was when Harari begins to talk about the future, especially the end. Nevertheless it is a book like none other I have reason the subject. It tops my list of must reads, and must read over and over again!"
Sapiens,Amazonian,Book quality like pirated copy,4,"Book ok...but the binding glue came undone after first read. It kind of felt like pirated copy that are sold on streets and inside train compartments by hawkers. I'm disappointed with the seller. Amazon should check whether pirated copies are sold using their platform while charging original price. I'm deducting one star only for that. Book language lucid. Students of human evolution, prehistory and archaeology, culture, and palaeontogy would find nothing new, neither the author claimed so. The book will serve its purpose to introduce preliminary idea to general public. That's no mean feat considering the vast range of topics. You'll get the idea why it became bestseller. Kudos to author."
Sapiens,Susruta Bandyopadhyay,a brave and novel look into the existence of man,4,"The author writes a history of humankind with a very original and brave outlook . He raises some fundamental questions , like what made a species of primates surge ahead of all other living beings in a span of some 50000 odd years? he answers them with some well researched ideas . In the process he juggles between the most diverse subjects like history , philosophy, economics and advanced biology , with elan . The book will keep one glued to its pages . One may agree with the author or may not , but definitely will enjoy being fascinated by his unconventional but brilliant thought process ."
Sapiens,Tanuj Kohli,Education from the word GO!,4,"This book feels like History of Earth and it's inhabitants served to the reader on a platter. Right from the beginning, the author questions and explains things that a person can never imagine even in its wildest dreams. This is not a history lesson but covers all historical events right from the word go. Every single line, para and chapter feels like education and anybody who reads it will come out more informed and educated. The language is simple and tells the story of Us. Kudos to the author for writing such a piece of art. Makes one realise that history was never meant to be taken for granted!"
Sapiens,Read N Rejoice,"An extraordinary book, but misses the less known facts!",4,"If you would like to understand mankind, you should certainly read this book. It covers the whole history of mankind since it evolved to the current day in a more psychological, social, economic, political and logical manner. No book had dealt this matter, in a way Yuval does it. However he relies mostly on the facts from 1990s and had not updated the latest findings. Of course, they are still evolving. However a researcher of Yuval's status' believing in the African migration theory is surprising! He should add a few recent findings as an epilogue to his newer versions. Nevertheless, an exciting book!"
Sapiens,Apurva Pendse,Brilliant!,4,"A comprehensive history of mankind. Must read to understand why we are what we are and many more questions. The author takes us through the various stages in our evolution and progress in the most interesting way. While also covering the cost of this progress to the ecology and other animals. A few parts in between regarding theology and religions can be skipped. Overall, a great read!"
Sapiens,A M,Worth reading!,4,"Read this book if you want to know: - How we evolved as humans &amp; destroyed our competitors - How and why we invented/discovered Money, Cultures, God, Nations, Religion - Why and what potential did Europe have that it dominated early modern period - How did Industrial revolution take place &amp; how we achieved Scientific breakthrough - Are we Happy? - What next stands before us Time consuming but time well spent. I enjoyed reading it!"
Sapiens,aps,Vast source of knowledge in terms of modern han evaluation and progress.,4,Product packaging was good but product was in distorted shape that's seller's fault. Otherwise product is stupendous enough to amaze and enhance your human experience as you roam through this enjoying historical universe.
Sapiens,Anuj,Great book,4,Good read
Sapiens,Shravani,Amazing read: makes one think above the imaginations intertwined in reality,4,"This book is amazing, i dont think i can say anything that is not already said about it. But i can add a con, that might be ignored my many. The historical facts in the book needs some check. Book talks about various religions and their view on life, being a hindu i didn't find the view mentioned accurate. Book doesn't answer some questions it poses, like the reason behind gender gap in power. If one can ignore a few reputations, it's a great read"
Sapiens,Rd Tiwari,History,4,The overall book is very good if you are a history lover
Sapiens,Ravi,Goid read,4,"Started this book with a blank opinion. This book makes you feel like an intellectual by unwinding each theories while letting you to guess it. But i think the author taunts humans so much for evolving and praises the past than the present or future. Though this book is made of facts and fictions, the author wins in grabbing yhe readers attention and holds it well. it was a great read."
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Will change your perspective,4,It's not just a history book but also a work of philosophy. I am not giving 5 stars because I believe the author could have done better with respect to Indian history and society but still it's an exemplary work
Sapiens,Aseef,Recommended reading,4,"They say books are mirrors - you only see in them what you already have inside you. Maybe. By that measure though, this one probably lets you see what you dont know is. It gives you stuff to think about. And it does it in a very pop sort of way. It has some critique going at it, and maybe rightly so. But I would definitely recommend this book to those that are looking for a fun read on some serious stuff. And I suppose that is what Dr.Harari intends."
Sapiens,Warrior Nameless,Wonderful,4,Wonderful at this Price from the seller YoungCraft
Sapiens,Rahul B.,Nice one,4,Nicely written. At some places I still found that too much significance is given to Europe. I liked the journey of Sapiens when they were hunters and gatherers because it is not generally discussed as compare to modern history. The last part of book is also much discussed but it always interesting to read more about future. Will certainly like to read others book by author
Sapiens,Pranav,Excellent Content but the print seems pirated,4,"There's zero doubt about the quality of the content. It's fantastic. But the the print seems pirated. The page quality is third class, font size is tiny and there's no way to ascertain if this is an original copy by Penguin."
Sapiens,PotterGirl26,Unputdownable,4,"If you havent read Sapiens, get your copy today. The book is not just great for refreshing your concepts of history, sociology and anthropology, but it also leaves you with a lot of points to consider and think in detail about. Go for it."
Sapiens,Ritika S.,Has subtle satires. I really like that about this book,4,"The paper, bind and print quality is great. About the book itself. I feel like I already knew this stuff. Of course that's because I had already heavily researched into evolution. So... That's that. This book is also about human history so I think it might start to enlighten me soon. Fingers crossed :)"
Sapiens,Alok Jha,Cognitive revolution of human being over the millions of years.,4,"I generally like to read history books. I bought this book with the mindset that I would about human history. However, when I started reading this book I came to know about a lot of intriguing dimensions of homo sapiens and also related topics especially a chapter in this book about agricultural revolution."
Sapiens,Shubham Kumar,Detailed information about human history,4,"Nice book to read, you can know about the human history how everything start how thinks change the whole human history ."
Sapiens,Kindle Customer,Great read,4,It was like a short recap of everything that has happened on earth so far with fascinating speculations of future.
Sapiens,SindhuPutra,It's a must read for all those want to understand History of Humans on Earth!,4,"The Original book was written way back in 2011 and after English translation it's spreading all over the world! For understanding History of Humans on earth, this is the book! Grab it, read it."
Sapiens,Adarsh Jha,"Amazing, thought provoking, I'll be reading the other 2 books of Yuval as well.",4,"The book was packed neatly in bubble wrap and delivered on time. Yuval is a modern day historian , facts in the book are tough to argue on. Reread as time goes on as you may lose some bits of information. Never thought I'll be reading history with so much interest."
Sapiens,Nimit Jain,A good book to know history of human,4,You can find a details logical and scientific analysis of fact known to us. An eye opener for all the myth frisking around
Sapiens,Assam Boy,Value of Knowledge....,4,A very good book as I read ever. People should read this book. Thanks to amazon.
Sapiens,Shibaji Mukherjee,This is a pretty big book to read,4,"This is a pretty big book to read, but it also covers a very vast spectrum. The main interesting point of this book is the very clinical way of writing. This is a good example of analytical history. Classical heritage of Asian civilization is somewhat not touched upon much and Europe is shown to be the originator of modernity. That is true, but from this book it seems all science originated only in Europe. Modern Analytical Science originated in Europe, but a vast body of scientific practices and knowledge was discovered in Asia, they were stated in a philosophical way, but that doesn't nullify the historical origin."
Sapiens,Santanu Dey,Good rear view mirror to the history oh humans,4,"Well written. The best part is how the author has blended the political history of the species with its biological, scientific and economic advances. Most fascinating of all how the author has shown that our ability to believe and execute based on narratives of collective imagination sets us apart from our less imaginative ancestors. System of money, companies, capitalism, law, nations, communism and even religion are nothing but theories that we collectively believe in."
Sapiens,VISHNU M A,A must read,4,This will change your view of the world
Sapiens,Srinivas,Opinionated with facts,4,"Sapiens is the first book I read which is above 500 pages . It covers I wide range of topics , I like cognitive revolution was the best part , I found agriculture's boring and religion was opinionated, last chapters were surprising. Industrial revolution was interesting . Facts with opinion . Gr8 ."
Sapiens,MD Irfan,"The past, present and plausible future",4,"This book tells us about our distant past along with our fellow friends who lived with us back then and how we overthrew the. The present where our peace is too recent and most fragile, and the future which no one knows about surely but only have an impression based on the current pattern."
Sapiens,daniel,The future of homo sapiens,4,"Our efficiency led to agriculture, mining...but the earth's ecosystem cannot go on providing for 7billion people...in the future for more humans...our growth will bring misery...unless we find another blue planet or modifies humans or let pandemics cull homo sapiens...good book which points human beings to this reality"
Sapiens,Ranjith,a recommended read for every human being - 'homo sapien',4,"Covered some handsome portion of this book so far. We read books on the same subject in regular academic curriculum. But this is a unified source of information and helps reader develop nice perception of universe, and its chemistry physiology, biology and history. a recommended read for every human being - 'homo sapien'!!"
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Definitely a good read,4,"This books gives you a fair picture of the evolution of Homo Sapiens. The story telling skill of the author is amazing and you will find yourself engrossed and by end you finish probably also would have learned a couple of new things. Though the book has been written in a fairly unbiased way, but it has elements of contemporary biases towards various religions. The one star less is only because of certain arguments that the author wrote definitively; while the argument cannot be proven to be cent percent true. Overall the read is worth it."
Sapiens,SwathiR,Fascinating,4,"Though Harari primarily focuses on topics that was mentioned earlier in scholastic history books, he enhances it by connecting the dots effectively in an unbiased manner. If you are someone who is excited about history, this book is your must list."
Sapiens,Harsh m.,Stimulating read.,4,"This book presents the history of the world in a new perspective. Several points such as downside of agriculture revolution, imagined realities are all thought provoking. But sometimes author builds idea on artful premises, which obviously amazes us but are a bit difficult to digest. But book is definitely worth a read."
Sapiens,Amit K.,Nice work,4,A book lover should study this book.
Sapiens,Panth Patel,Good quality sent from Amazon,4,After 2 times replacement received proper book from amazon. Nice service provided by Amazon. Please take this as feedback - request to eliminate duplicate book sellers and provide original books for buyers.
Sapiens,Sanskriti,Quality is good,4,"I brought the special collector edition for inr 451 , pages are thick and prints are super good ,i m little disappointed with book cover,it looks old but rest i m in love with this edition."
Sapiens,Pravin Prakash Rai,Marvelous boo.,4,It's contents.
Sapiens,Gourab Bansal,very informative,4,must read.
Sapiens,vp,Must read!,4,"Robustly researched, clearl and apparently objective portrayal of our species that celebrates our successes and confronts our failures in equal measure. Like looking in a mirror when the light is just right, so as not to blind or hide."
Sapiens,Pradip,The book is good but it came slightly slightly damaged,4,This is a great book to read if you are interested in the history of mankind. Its very well written in and is easy to read for long stretches of time even if its subject is quite serious. My only problem is that the book was packaged poorly and when I got it the cover was creased and folded. Amazon should package books in hard boxes. People like to treasure them.
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Good book but there is an Indian writing which is is in similar line,4,Volga to Ganges by rahul sahityayan is the version best suited. This topic is only advanced by time
Sapiens,Kindle Customer,Interesting read..!!,4,"Recommended for everyone. Will force you to think differently. Explained the change from one revolution to another that resulted in state where we are now. Along with the facts, the book presents opinions of writer as well."
Sapiens,Mohit,only for those who are interested in past of humankind. for everyone choose home deus.,4,this book is good but for those who are interested in past. for future there is home deus. and 21 lessons from 21st century.
Sapiens,Priti Aisola,Aham Brahmasmi,4,A comprehensive history of Sapiens but underestimates and underplays the Spiritual element. The divine is not a psychological construct but the ultimate truth arrived at on the Spiritual Path. Once there is self-realisation there is no more 'Becoming.'
Sapiens,Rajendiran,Must buy,4,This book is very usefull fr every citizen without understanding history no one can successfully in their carrier must buy very usefull very new topic I loved it
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Torn corners and dented edges spoil the fun,4,"A lucid read! The delivered book had damaged corners and edges. Worse, this is to be gifted to someone immediately, which leaves me disappointed about the Seller. Delivery was good though"
Sapiens,Prasad,Read it,4,"provocative odyssey through mankind's history over time. There were some great clarifications of why we are as we are and how things grown.The book covers an incredible 13.5 billion years of pre-history and history of humankind. I generally appreciate books like this to some degree since it gives me an alternate perspective. The book was very intriguing in the beginning, but then it dragged at the end."
Sapiens,MJ,The Thought of big picture,4,"This is the book which you can refer to your fellow friends/Loved ones, who takes religion, cast,race,gender and other wastes as a serious matter in their small life...The book may atleast disturb them to question their stands.."
Sapiens,Usha,Missed having amazon book mark with it,4,The book is awesome. Came in good quality and on time. I just wonder why amazon has stopped giving book marks with the books.
Sapiens,Aniket a.,Treasure,4,I recommend this book to everyone who wants to know about past and future of humankind and i also want to thanks to Dr Harari to write such an incredible book.
Sapiens,rakesh kumar,Good quality and amazing to read. But you need to have interest in history,4,The media could not be loaded. You can buy it so go and buy it
Sapiens,Amit Pingale,Good value for money,4,Just got delivery from Amazon &amp; U-read. Good print and paper quality. Inside photos are of medium quality with black and white print. All in all good quality book print
Sapiens,ashish,Its amazing how Harai managed to condense such humongous timeline in ...,4,There is something wrong with the seller. I got a used copy. The book was not packed when arrived and had numerous folds and cracked front cover. Coming to the book its brainstorming and a must read if you want to know how we 'humans' evolved. Its amazing how Harai managed to condense such humongous timeline in 461 pages being so meticulous and comprehensive. And 4 stars because of sellers otherwise it would have been 5.
Sapiens,Ashok Krishna,Don't fall for the hype!,3,"I have read quite a number of books that ended up disappointing me. Some of those were gifted by well-meaning friends. Some of them were books I bought on an impulse. Then there were books that I had waited years to read only to find them unworthy of all those years of patience. But this book by Yuval Noah Harari tops the list. Just imagine reading a book that all your friends were going gaga about, only to find that there is nothing worthwhile in it and wondering whether you are really a good reader at all, now that you dont even like a book that the whole world around you seems to love! Lets clear a few things first, before you think of bashing me up. This is a commendable effort by Mr. Harari to summarize the whole history of mankind and its evolutionary tale. During the initial pages, I too thought that this will be one of the best reads on anthropology. But this book promises a lot only to deceive. We statisticians use the term confirmation bias, which means the tendency to favor and present only those information that are supportive to ones beliefs. This book is full of them. Harari had decided to present all that is wicked and weak about Homo Sapiens and he has succeeded to a large extent. Not that I am complaining. I for one have never held the notion that we humans are special beings sitting atop the food chain, placed there by a favorable god who created us all in his (or, is it a her?) own image. I think of us as a different species of apes that managed to evolve a little quicker than our cousins. Despite our use of advanced languages, costly clothes and snazzy gadgets, internally we remain the beasts that roamed the vast forests once. I see nothing special about being human. This book helped cement that belief in my mind by discussing the idiocies and idiosyncrasies of our species as a whole. But thats just about it. This book isnt a brief history of humankind, but the opinions of Mr. Harari about the various aspects of human evolution. This isnt a chronological history in the lines of What on Earth Happened? by Christopher Lloyd or A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson, both of which I found to be far more informative and interesting than this one. This is both a philosophical take and passing of judgments by Mr. Harari on what he considers to be the vital cogs of human evolution, namely Cognitive Revolution, Agricultural Revolution &amp; Scientific Revolution. There is nothing that you end up learning that you already didnt learn, especially in case you had read those two aforementioned books. Sorry, dear friends. I have read much better books. 2.5 stars!"
Sapiens,Shipra,Boring,3,Lengthy n boring
Sapiens,asha j,Could have been consistently engaging,3,"This could have been a consistently engaging read because it's written in clear, simple language and certainly contends with grand ideas but the gaps in data and analyses left my curiosity stranded and re-purposed to poking holes in the arguments for the most part instead of propelling it. Spoilers My evaluation of the book downgraded from 3 at the beginning to 2 stars by the end because there were some chapters in the 3rd and 4th parts that just put me off his style of research and writing-chapters 11, 15 and 16. Couldn't put my opinion on chapter 17 and 18 in perspective after that and didn't particularly care for or agree with Chapter 19. The last chapter was made interesting by the sheer subject matter more than anything in the writing. This is around half the book. I do like some of his ideas which, without commenting on originality, at least imply analytical rigour, like the fate of animals stuck on our indifferent conveyor belts which even the most passionate postcolonial thinkers seemingly fail to question, or the dangers of historical determinism in determining our future course/s. These ideas however, are couched in between claims and conclusive jumps that don't seem to be launched from solid theoretical platforms or even if they are, I'm left contemplating their plausibility because he does not do a good job of referencing enough literature or providing these additional details in the text himself. For e.g., his flights from the bankruptcy of the Mississippi Company in 1719 to the French Revolution in 1789 as the eventual outcome without referencing one little American Revolution the way we are classically taught...History pruned and painted in the service of a punchline. This affects the way I interpret other anecdotes which the book is peppered with even when these have a stronger correlation, and more importantly, causality-which for all his caution on determinism, Hariri sometimes conflates. We can correlate the rise of science and Empire but can we effectively claim that the imperial project was undergirded by western scientific rigour, without which it would have been difficult to sustain? In other cases, the ideas are too simplistic to really enthuse a reader with a basic orientation to world events, like his exposition on capitalism-wasn't it just Capital to think of such a revolutionary idea, and we'll get to the discussion on market failures later in a tiny, adjunct way."
Sapiens,Rudra,Satisfied,3,The book came in a pretty nice box. I thought it would be in the condition that I expected it to be in but there were some black spots on the book and some finger nail marks plus the spine was a little tormented. Expected a little better condition but still overall happy with the purchase...
Sapiens,KRISHNAVENI SUBBIAH,Read if you are ready!,3,"Sapiens had been that one book everyone would keep recommending to read. It was so intriguing for me to read this book (with special mention to my inconsistent non-fiction love) and I've been waiting to get my hands on it. Everything about this book sounds fascinating... the blurb, the reviews etc. I absolutely loved the first half of the book which talks more about the biological evolution and nomadic and natural lifestyle. It was so very informative and interesting as well. But the second half didn't stick with me so much because it was full of historic facts, conquests and stuffs. I felt a bit bored at the later point of time though I would say the same may not happen with all the readers. The book is definitely one of the amazing works and a must read for anyone interested in history and the way we humans have become the supremacy on Earth. It in fact made me feel all these advancements we make leads us no where but destruction. If you ask me which book apart from fiction would I cherish forever, it would be this book. Because, I knew I would read this book so many times in future because it has so much in it. Wrapping up things, read this book of you are genuinely interested and have done enough research beforehand."
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Pages quality is not good in hardbound Indian edition,3," The media could not be loaded. You would think that after buying hardbound version, you will get better quality pages but that's not the case, page quality feels cheap"
Sapiens,Ajey,A good read to mark if off the list,3,"Giving 3 ratings because it did not turn out to be what I expected. I was expecting it to be more of a peek into how we evolve as humans from earlier ages to current age. However, the book is more around the main milestones in the human history like early life, agriculture, money and science. In each of the section the initial chapters cover the history or evolution. But then remaining chapters are more based on authors thoughts, perspectives. Not at all engaging. Does not make you keep reading it. In fact, I was going to leave it but finished it to mark it off my list. The 3 starts are for the content of the book and the research. However, if you are someone who likes reading something which is interesting and engaging then skip it."
Sapiens,Diya Pramanik,The book in itself is brilliant! But terribly packaged order.,3,"The book in itself is of course brilliant. But the packaging was terrible! It was only wrapped in a single amazon plastic bag and that's it. The edges of the book are damaged. I preferred not to return the book as it's a brilliant read! History , anthropology enthusiasts and anyone for that matter should read it!"
Sapiens,Placeholder,Paperback edition and not collector's edition but a book to be read,3,"THe product is advertised as collector's edition with colourful photographs. The product received is a paperback edition with black and white photographs. The supplier should desist giving false descriptions misleading gullible purchasers. The book is a must read for everyone. The author objectively analyses the origin of our species takes step by step upto the present stage. The entire narrative is lased with humour at the same time the analysis is very objective and unbiased. The book is 450 pages long and hence needs some perseverance to complete it. On the whole the book is quite interesting except at few locations when it talks about conquests especially by Romans and Greeks. This is is not to take away thought provoking concepts on languages, religions, communism &amp; capitalism, shared myths like nations, joint stock company etc to name a few. Again his chapter on what causes happiness is really thought provoking. On the whole it is a great book to be remembered forever."
Sapiens,Abhishek Thakur,Thought provoking but very poor understanding and appreciation of India,3,"Definitely thought-provoking. Harari's first book, it also shows how poorly he (in fact, the entire Western establishment) knows and thinks of India. The most controversial conjecture in the book is that the shift to agriculture was humankind's biggest fraud. Even a layperson can bore holes in his arguments. Not enough nutrition? Farmers can rear animals, even hunt them occasionally and grow fruits and vegetables too. They surely don't only eat the grains they have harvested! Harari's thought process ironically shows the limitations of the Western reductionist thinking, needing a focal point and ignoring the overall context and interrelationships"

Sapiens,Placeholder,Brilliant in parts and very ordinary otherwise,3,"Brilliant in parts but pretty ordinary in the rest. Dr. Harari seems to let his personal preferences get the better of himself in parts. While he talks about several myths he espouses several myths - that resources available are infinite, academics have caused progress (read Antifragile by Nassim Taleb) , scientists solve human problems, medicine has benefitted mankind (please read Death by Medicine by Gary Null). Well in parts all of these myths are true but would have appreciated Dr. Harari going into the details of conflicts of interest and other biases that prevent these institutions from doing what they are supposed to do. Did like the book in parts and several insights are remarkable but this book proves that it is very difficult for a person who has been institutionalised to write an honest account of the institution. He is too much of a scientist/academic to do justice to the true record of science/academia. A much better book on all counts would be Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb."
Sapiens,H. Singharay,Full of sweeping one liners,3,"At best the book glosses over too many key subjects and at its worst throws highly superficial one liners. I have made up a whole list of such inaccuracies but let this one suffice : the author believes that English could rule India because English language was linguistic sister of Sanskrit and other Indian languages. No, Sir! The rulers in the Whitehall had no clue about it. It was the Asiatic Society and honourable William Jones who established it while the British soldiers and rulers went about in their ignorant way. Sweeping comments on historical events do not help. There was so much of hype! Surely the book appeals to half literate intelligentsia"
Sapiens,Ayshwarya,Overrated!!!,3,"This book is worth a read, but certainly feel that this book is over rated. While we get a inner peek into humankind and history, I feel the author is a bit all over the place at times. Also, there are lots of pointless open ended questions which don't add any value. The book could have been 100 pages lesser. Also, the images used, at times, do not compliment the story - seems very random. In summary, a decent read, but not worth the hype."

The delivery guy has thrown the package into the campus of my residence which is followed by a heavy rain and the water found its way to creep inside the package. Thankfully it wasn't an electronic product but the product had seeped in the water which made the product to lose its look. I highly insist amazon to look into such issues which reflects on them. As I'm a regular user or amazon this kind of irresponsive act saddens me.

Sapiens,Shubham,Book is excellent but the gift option is not.,3,It was a gift. But the gift wrappingb is worst. It looks like somone had tore it after it was packed. The quote I requested to be printed on the card is also so badly printed that it's barely readable in parts. Book is in good condition but the whole point of gifting someone is to give the gift in proper packaging. I expected more delicacy in handling a gift. Maybe the expectation was too much.
Sapiens,SUNIL SINGH,A good Read.,3,"A good read I was amazed by the fact that Dr Yuval has put in this book. Tremendous amount of hardwork and beautiful piece of information. The book takes you on a journey of humans from their first kind to the present kind, i.e., homo rudolf.to homo sapiens. When the book started with the information that Rudolf., Neanderthal, and erectus weren't the part of one evolutionary lineage but were different species on different regions of earth, I was shocked . Till date I knew them as our successors. The author starts beautifully with cultural revolution, agricultural revolution, empirical revolution and then to scientific revolution. Such effortful journeys, with too much information. I believe the author must have had a very very hard time knitting all the facts in a few pages. * You tend to hate Britishers for realising that they are the main reason why the world has seen so many scientific revolutions. *You will hate them for introducing the first almost universally accepted currency. *Hating them for finding so many new countries, unifying the community and establishing laws. As much as the book has sung the praises song for the Europeans and Britishers, the book has dedicated 2 pages on the ideologies of Buddha (heartfelt thanks). Occasionally the author has related some of the scientific, religious findings with the Buddhists thinking. Seems he has some inclination towards Buddhist ideologies. Great. The book also talks about the hypocrisy of humans. On one side we show our affection for animals and the very next second we are showing monstrous behaviour with hens, cows, pigs and horses. Some great words and examples by the author will touch your emotional nerves. Last but not the least, the author is a humorous person too. Great sense of humour, one Cannot deny. Be it talking about the baptism of Jesus, or about the death of the 16th born son Edward. He has touched your laughter soul brilliantly. Overall it's a good book, try to read it slowly and patiently. Don't fall dizzy behind the desks of overwhelming dates and periods in the book. By the time you have finished the book, you'll realise you knew so little of the world and now you have known something more about it."
Sapiens,anirudh.srinivas94@gmail,Print on the gift message Horrible,3,"I specifically asked this gift to have a beautiful message written, bit it looks like the print is horrible and that makes the gift not as worthy as I thought it would be.... disappointed"
Sapiens,Neha Singh,Intersecting facts and diagnosis,3,Book starts with very interesting facts of how homo sapiens came into being and ends with not so intersecting take on scientific revolution. Most of us would already know many of the facts but it is interesting to read them in the continuity of evolution. Hindus especially brahminical ones should take a note that homo sapiens have been non vegeterains since eternity except last few years and have survived thousand years. Book gives detailed account and reasoning on how humans started forming groups and empires after that. Evolution of language happened as a means to gossip and was not basic for survival. Book has nothing new to offer when it starts talking about empires and modern human history. Great start and average ending.
Sapiens,Dilip Yadav M,Worst Amazon Gift wrap !!!,3,"Book was good , but I am totally unhappy with the Amazon packing ! I ordered the book as a gift wrap and they charged me 30Rs for that . It's d cheapest wrapper I have ever seen ! Thin than toilet tissue paper . The wrap was so thin that , the entire wrap was torn and just the paper was folded around the book . Please don't buy Amazon gift wrap . I could have got a better gift wrap for 10Rs . But it was for my friend birthday and thought Amazon gift wrap would look better Total waste of money and time ."

Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Good,3,Once readable.different perspectives are told.
Sapiens,Surbhi Sinha,"Interesting but heavy read, remember there's a fine line between facts and opinions.",3,"Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is one humongous book which tends to live on many peoples bookshelves for a long time. Its been on mine too, for the longest time as well for well over 2 years precisely. I picked up this book alongside many others as part of a read-along I host on my Bookstagram handle with the tag #theurbanreadalongs. Like many of the other readers I had my doubts and apprehensions about selecting a 500 page non-fiction book. A quick overview on the division of the book, its bound together by 4 revolutionary events in the relatively short history of our species existence: - The Cognitive Revolution - The Agriculture Revolution - The Industrial Revolution - The Scientific Revolution These four revolutions talk about our transformation from being insignificant apes to rulers of this planet. Harari has very carefully tried to construct a story of our existence by taking into account multiple theories acknowledged by historians around the world. From those theories he tries to give us a clearer picture of our past. The problem I faced with this was that he tried to make sense of our evolution by going back and forth on those multiple theories as per his convenience, after all it is his story in the end. Having said that, I would be very cautious to consider theories as facts as sometimes its easy to misunderstand and merge the two as the same. Id ask all readers to be careful of differentiating between the two while reading Sapiens. Keep in mind that this is one historians perspective of our evolution and I did find many of them to be amusing. One of my favorite parts in the book was the one titled as The Unification of Humankind. In this part Harari has talked about everything from culture to ideologies. In fact I agree with him when he calls modern ideologies as a form of religion too. An introduction to the concept of individualism and how it came to be romanticized was quite interesting to read about as well. This, alongside The Scientific Revolution will hit closest to home as the history of these two revolutions dates back to only two centuries ago placing us not from some of the most exciting times in the history of our existence. The earlier parts had helped me see things from a different perspective and even gain new ones on some others. It helped me understand some very minute and major habits which we have today. An example which was given very early on about our head size and how that impacted the mother during child birth or our fascination and gorging habits on sweets and oily food. I didnt know of that and I had never thought about it before. The origin of Charles Dickens The Tale of Two Cities and of course a deeper insight into the word meme were some great additions to the book in my opinion. But I occasionally felt that Harari was a bit too repetitive about some topics such as money and imagination, as he kept bringing up the two concepts and ended up explaining them way too many times. I cant single-handedly point out anything specific in the book which was inaccurate as they were theories followed by his opinions on them. This book is like an onion with many overlying layers, each one stretching our brains capacity and making us question everything as we know it. For me the reading experience was a roller coaster ride, from being excited about reading the book to being disappointed to the point of quitting it. From it making me go woahh to ending up in an existential crisis questioning everything weve done as a species to come this far and of how capable we are to bring even more destruction from here on. Making me realize towards the end that maybe the future of our species is even more terrifying than the past weve lived through. Its an exhausting book trying to tell us of our survival and growth till this point in time and I am glad to have picked it up and given it a chance. I do recommend this book to those who are looking for a different and a somewhat easily comprehensible perspective of our evolution, with a fair warning to not take the authors musings as facts. I rate Sapiens 3 out of 5 bookmarks, because of the multiple times it made me want to quit reading it and also because of the parts where Mr.Harari has chosen to be a hypocrite. It has been quite the challenge to finish this one and Im glad to have overcome it but I dont think Ill be picking up another in this series anytime soon."
Sapiens,KM,Un-informed about indian context,3,"I believe the author has deliberately overlooked or has grossly overlooked indian contribution to the overall evolution of society culture n literature. He has failed to mention the origin of sanskrit which was the most predated n the first if full scripts in the world. Language hence was at the peak in this region. Social stratification was as a result of aryan invasion. This is already debunked. The author needs to b updated. If he simply factors in the evolution of civilization in india with its following discoveries in science, math, astrology, astronomy, law, spiritual realm and occult sciences he need not write an entire book about the origins of the same in americas or elsewhere, cause this region was the epicentrr of all sciences and spiritual realm alike. Math was not refined by arabs ..it was already borrowed by greeks from ancient indians and used over centuries before islam in its most refined state. The author has misgivings about agro society and its revolution and why it was the worst thing to happen. I argue that it was a natural progression. I wont see it as bAd. Why would humans wanna continue as foragers all their lives? Agriculture..societies..civilization..laws..punishments..were a natural progression and men did best with their developed/developing minds. Indian social stratification was based on division of labor to begin with n not some cosmic law, though evil did creep into the society later post vedic making it inflexible. The idea was beautiful to begin with with enough flexibilty to cross over based on merit, to streamline n make the society efficient. These days authors read bits n pieces of info from here n there.. add their own spin based on their own conditioning which they apply to guage every culture with the same biases. Three stars is because despite the lacunae in research pertaining to indian history and culrure the rest of the essays are interesting and informative. Ps* 1. minor objections are that the aryan theory is already debunked. Author requires to update. 2. Indians had already a good maritime activity in place long before columbus etc from port of surat..jamnagar etc later portugese in 16-17th century monopolised the routes. Whn britishers came to india they systematically destroyed the shipping business and monopolised it. Similarly rail roads were added snatching away peasant lands to mobilise army quickly after 1857. Also ferrying of loot became easier. Its a different story later gandhi used to same trains to launch civil disobidience movement. 3. Sanskritised educationwas looked down upon and an urgent need to teach western efucation to civilize the populace was put into action n championed by macualay. In short the imperialism hurt india immensely."
Sapiens,Raj,Ok,3,Ok
Sapiens,Sagar,More like 'a brief history of my thoughts',2,How is an entire (Indian) subcontinent excluded from the book? Is it not part of the 'human' history the writer wants to tell or there are some parts of the world not 'human enough'?
Sapiens,A Sanyal,Disappointing !,2,"I was really enjoying the book until I reached the part where it perpetuated the myth of Aryan Invasion how the Aryan race invaded India, subjugated the indigenous population and created the Caste System to continue the subjugation. It was found that this invasion theory was created by real invaders in the early 20th century, to justify their rule over India. And later perpetuated by political parties who gained from it. No archaeological evidence was ever found supporting the Aryan invasion. Yet the author chose to include it in the book and make it sound academic. Now I doubt everything about every culture written in this book. ANTHROPOLOGY IS NOT SCIENCE. It is based on building consensus. Every reader should keep that in mind. Im giving this book 2 stars instead of 1, just because of the lucidity of its language and impressive story telling."
Sapiens,Just Another Customer,okayish,2,"Half the book is very interesting after which it becomes a drag to read. Too preachy with less history. His book begins in a most promising way, weaving history and narrative in a way that breaks down preconceived notions of linear evolution. It's terrific at this point. At roughly page 120, the book begins to veer into a bizarre social justice screed, and the author begins citing as true facts things that are neither footnoted nor true. It became so poorly sourced and agenda-driven that I had to set it down, as it differed significantly from all that preceded it. It's not a history - it's 'Pop History.' Superficial with lots of bold assertions without any corroborating evidence. With five minutes on Google you can discover that some of the most outlandish stories are false. At many times in the book I felt the author departed from what scientific evidence/research supports and instead conveyed a more political/biased view of things. I would have liked to have him bring his educated opinions, emotions and humanity into the book more directly and openly, with facts and ideas that show how he arrived at these beliefs, rather than disguise his emotions as science and cherry pick a few facts to support himself. It cheapened what could otherwise have been a very good, thought provoking and otherwise well written book. Given his next book is about the future, I am going to avoid it. In the middle of the book, I even wanted to give it up. Towards the end I had to push myself through the book."
Sapiens,Placeholder,Mostly speculative,2,Full of speculations. Though the points seem convincing to lay man but anyone with scientific temper would not fall for superficial logics.
Sapiens,MURALi,Fully hyped book with little evidence to support and it is full of personal opinions,2,"This is one of the most hyped books, with little substance. Many scientists have rebuked this book with no scientific evidence. He takes selective points that suit his opinions and makes it a nice story. His understanding of biology is poor. He did not read any Eastern philosophy and history. The whole book is about Europe/America, but he has no understanding of Asia/Russia and Africa. Surprised that this is highly recommended. One thing i see, if you need attention, write something against valid evidence. People become more ignorant by reading this book. He has no understanding of any religion. Just writing everything is myth/ Agriculture is curse to humanity."
Sapiens,M.Bhargavi Priya,Not a brilliant one,2,"The world around always fascinates me. I find the stories of this only known planet to support life's formation and evolution of humans, it's the most dominant and intelligent species, to be mesmerising. With the same interest to know more about this planet I picked up this book. Cognitive revolution was informative, but the author didn't provide much evidence to what he's claiming would've happened. After I read the Agricultural Revolution, I found myself hating the humans for what they have done to other species. I observed that almost every activity of mine in a day starting from a cup of coffee in the morning to a woollen rug in the night, everything is hurting another species. But this is not what this book has promised me. That's when I stopped reading it. So, I didn't/couldn't read it completely. Also, the writing was sloppy and so plain. I didn't find any noteworthy lines or a part that I would term to be literary brilliance."
Sapiens,Bridventure,Waste of money to bue this book (even 2nd hand).,2,"I wish I had previewed the book before buying. I was put off within the 40th page. The very meaning of Sapiens is 'wise', so homo sapiens means a wise human, and as such man has evolved through more and more complex thinking, correcting his sense of philosophy and related outlooks towards morality and living. I expected this book to give a lofty treatment to the topic, but Hariri has made it a maudlin call to save humanity from itself! Authors would usually spell out what their goals for the book are in an 'Introduction', which is absent here. Hariri then misuses the very common understanding of words like, myth, story, fiction, exist(ance), assuming that his implications are self evident and needs no explanation. For example, he calls Peogeot company and human rights are 'fictions' without justifying. This book just doesn't sensibly cover the 70,000 years of Human History, but is only the author's way of crying at some injustice he has suffered (unknown to us)."
Sapiens,Vinod Krishnan,Biased writing / Dissappointed,2,"Initial pages around 150 pages, till he starts writing about India. But what he wrote about India was utter false. He could have avoided writing about India portion. Disappointed by the work. I know this book has received rave reviews. I could not continue reading, dropped the book."
Sapiens,vijay,THIS BOOK ALSO BASEDON SOME MYTHS CAMW FROM HIS BRAIN. OUTRAGOUS CLAIMS WITHOUT FULL EVIDENCES,2,"2 star for his outrageous claims.he claimed Biology taught evolution but the fact is biologists taught/teaches the evolution. The actual biology, biochemical complex ity points to the designer. He intentionally misquoted some of the biblical references to support his views(ex:deu 22) . He told God, money, language etc. are myth if that is the case the very language he used to convey the message came from his brain is also a myth I. e his message is myth."
Sapiens,AB,Good only in first quarter,2,"After one fourth of the content, the book became boring. It sounded more like author putting his own perception on how things are going on in the world. Expected to learn more about the history of humans from the start but didn't really gain much from it."
Sapiens,Nitin,Read first 40%,2,"Initially I felt that it's the best book I have ever read. As I completed half of it, I started to get bored. First half goes with a good pace. In all civilizations which he mentioned, he mentioned nothing about Indian civilizations. In fact during that era, Indian or Chinese were amongst one of the wealthiest."
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Poor Quality paper and print,2,The books paper quality and print with regards to font and spacing is not satisfying.The quality is poor and not in line with the publishing copies. Request you to work on improving the quality which directly enhances reader experience of book life. Thanks
Sapiens,kushal gokhale,"more emphasis to opinions, less to the history",2,"I stopped reading the book after a few initial pages. There is a likelihood that the author has written whatever was coming to his mind. The transition from being hunters and gatherers into a more settled way of living with agriculture as a source of food, is a 'fraud' according to the author."

Sapiens,Shantanu,Didn't like the flow of the book,2,"Why would anyone write a voluminous book when the matter is limited. It's too many examples for the subject. Writer has his own theory, though convincing sometimes, losses steam by the end"
Sapiens,Saurabh,Spoiler alert!! Humans are being cultivated by wheat and cotton for thousands of years,2,"I could not find anything revealing in this book except for humans killing all the large animals of all the continents. I found it ridiculous when the author wrote 'humans being cultivated by wheat and cotton' to keep themselves alive and not vice versa. Honestly, I could not finish the book because of utter non sense most of the time. Had great expectations with this book as so many people recommended it and was highly regarded but could not impress me. Anyway, who am I to judge."
Sapiens,M Praveen,Not a new book,2,"This is definitely not new, looks like it is picked from garbage"
Sapiens,mr.HULK,Book condition was disappointing.,2,The condition of the Book was bad and dusty. Its was not in the mint new condition .
Sapiens,Pratik Gupte,Somewhat superficial,2,"This book reads like a TED talk would sound, and has possibly been written for a generation that considers those a source of real knowledge. Much, if not most of it is pure speculation, and the book as a whole is very poorly referenced. I think it's a decent read if you want to provoke debate, and introduce general audiences to a number of concepts in human history, but that's it."
Sapiens,Customer,Dirty book,2,The book came in a dusty condition.
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,Drawn out.,2,Few chapters provide you a new perspective but the book is generally repetitive. What can be said in a paragraph has been said in 2-4 pages. Average read

Sapiens,Ram Chandra Pandit,Facts lacks evidence. Not so fascinating.,2,Well not so fascinating I found reading book. Good paper quality by vintage.
Sapiens,krishna k.,Highly negatively biased towards Indian Civilization,2,"The author is highly negatively biased towards Indian Civilization. He continues to promote many long-debunked narratives like the Aryan Invasion Theory and the notion of women's inferior condition in India's past. In reality, the Aryan Invasion Theory is gradually shifting from an invasion perspective to a migration theory to a tourism theory, and more people are becoming aware of the true history of Indian Civilization. Furthermore, historical evidence shows that women like Gargi and Lopamudra were significant contributors to the Vedas, which are among the oldest known texts to humanity. Therefore, it becomes evident that the author is pushing a particular agenda through this book. Nonetheless, the book is very well-structured and well-written."
Sapiens,Aalochak,Two Stars,2,First few chapters are really interesting! Rest of the book repeats a lot of known details.The language is pedantic.

Sapiens,Anjan Singh,"Overpraised, full of shallow opinions of author",2,"I am just halfway throug the book which is before the modern times of humans being discussed. Till whatever I have read, this book seems to full of authors opinions without any credible evidences. Moreover, the opinions are prejudiced and biased, most likely influenced by his upbringing in European/western ways of living. The author uses a random archeological samples to back his opinion and reject counter possibilities with no regards. To pick such a topic, one has to be have knowledge of most of ancient cultures of world and pick commonality from them to understand how possible human lived before modern times. The author seems to have knowledge of mid European cultures only and have based all his assertions and conclusion as if that's how entire human race across the planed lived and evolved."
Sapiens,Mansi Mishra,Harari's lack of knowledge and narrative bias shines throughout,2,"The book give you the illusion of actually reading something smart but its a mismanaged pile of facts woven in cock and bull narrative. The lack of a scientific approach in dealing with complex anthropology is evident. This book is only for novice readers, not something that adds value to their knowledge or understanding of the world."
Sapiens,vaibhav singh,"Bored , over rated",2,The author is only trying to imply that ' we ' home sapiens are the worst creation of the human race . Honestly speaking as I am not much into history so I found this book boring...that's all for the review .

Sapiens,Nitesh_industrial designer,Definitely not the original one,2,This book I received was torn but the quality of paper and print was so good but as if was torn out I had to return it. And the replacement I received was definitely poor in paper and print quality. So i believe its not the original copy what I have received as a replacement.
Sapiens,Jalim_Duniya,A Disappointing and Biased Historical Account,1,"As an avid enthusiast of human history and the dawn of sapiens, I was excited to delve into Yuval Noah Harari's book 'Sapiens' and explore the journey of humanity from its earliest days. However, my experience with the book left me profoundly disappointed and frustrated. Firstly, the book's title and description led me to believe that it would primarily cover the history of human kind from the sapiens age. Unfortunately, I found that a significant portion of the content was focused on events from the 18th and 19th centuries, which are well-documented in numerous other sources. This was not the comprehensive historical exploration I was hoping for, as I had already encountered this information elsewhere. One of the most glaring issues I encountered was the evident bias throughout the narrative. Harari's portrayal of historical events and religious perspectives seemed to reflect a particular agenda rather than an impartial presentation of facts. As a reader seeking an objective account of human history, I found this bias both disheartening and misleading. Moreover, it was evident to me that the research into certain regions and religions was lacking, particularly when it came to India and Hinduism. Given the profound influence that Indian civilization and Hinduism have had on the world, their treatment in the book felt superficial and incomplete. I believe that a more comprehensive understanding of these subjects would have enriched the narrative and made it more well-rounded. Similarly, I was troubled by the book's representation of Islam as an overwhelmingly important religion. While Islam indeed holds significance in world history, it should not overshadow or diminish the importance of other major religions and belief systems. This skewed portrayal further contributed to the sense of bias and misrepresentation present in the book. Regrettably, these issues culminated in my decision to abandon the book midway through reading. The lack of objectivity and the significant historical gaps were simply too frustrating to overlook. While 'Sapiens' may resonate with some readers, particularly those with a limited knowledge of history, it is essential to approach it with a critical mind and seek additional sources to gain a more balanced understanding of the topics discussed. As for myself, I have chosen to part ways with the book by disposing of it, as it doesn't align with the educational and factual reading experience I had hoped for. In conclusion, I cannot recommend 'Sapiens' for readers seeking a comprehensive and unbiased history of human kind. Instead, I encourage individuals to explore alternative sources that offer a more objective perspective on this fascinating subject."
Sapiens,s. b. iqbal,"Narratives, Narratives and more narratives",1,Do yourself a favour and buy David Graeber's books but avoid Mr Hararis vending....as in BS Vending. Harari is a story teller who is disguising himself as a historian. He is a perfect analogy of a Karl Popper style historian who backfits every historical event.
Sapiens,Sujoy,Bad paper qlty,1,Paper qlty is too bad.. Looks like the book printed 5 yrs before..
Sapiens,Divya,Not a Book for the Spiritual Minded,1,At times directly writes that spirituality makes people believe in things which are not correct! You can avoid reading it if you think that in life not everything falls under the realm of only logic and reasoning. Absolutely not recommended for the Spiritual Minded!!
Sapiens,Rahul Bansal,Delivered with stains,1,New book is delivered with stains on it
Sapiens,Keshav K.,Full of imagination,1,I dont agree with his imaginations and assumptions
Sapiens,sajith,Mistake regarding Hindu caste system and god,1,"There is a grave mistake in the book regarding Hindu Varna system that the author mention as caste. The varna system divide people into 4 groups such as Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudra which is based on qualities of behavior not by birth.. Bhagavat gita 18:42 clearly mention the qualities required for becoming a Brahmin. It is also found that the book mention Atman as universal God in Hinduism. It is a terrible mistake.. As per Upanishads and Bhagavat Gita, Brahman is considered as the supreme God and Atman is just soul."
Sapiens,OBSERVER,Less facts and more personal opinions,1,"This is a book for you if you like reading stories. At many places, the facts are presented incorrectly. For example, in chapter 12, he writes '... In Hindu polytheism, a single principle, Atman, controls the myriad gods and spirit, humankind, and the biological and physical world. Atman is the eternal essence or soul of the entire universe, as well as of every individual and every phenomenon.' Anyone who studied Hinduism will find it difficult to digest. Also his comments on communism and Buddhism reflects his superficial understanding of the subject. The book is full of personal opinions and more like a work of fiction. The author adopted the reductionist approach of science to depict humans and nature merely as complicated machines and predicted that the artificial intelligence would soon replace every function of human cognition. The author preaches his philosophy authoritatively."
Sapiens,Amazon_Customer,Too expensive and no colour image.,1,"I thought being hardcover and expensive then other version, it would have colour images. Totally disappointed with 10th year anniversary edition."
Sapiens,Dipankar,Rubbish,1,Yuval Noah Harari is a disaster. His work reeks of unresearched unverified populist hearsay. A complete waste of time for me. I prefer nuanced and well researched work. This is just populist fantasy completely disregarding evolutionary biology and all scholarly works preceding it
Sapiens,Amazon Customer,"left-centered Book, Facts to be taken with grain of salt.",1,"Conclusion This book tells of the evolution of our species from hunter-gatherers to farmers to the current day through his impactable storytelling competency and how it binds our cultures and societies together, with scientific significance. This book is well worth reading for those who are intrigued with world history and a philosophical optical canvass of what life is all about and how it shaped in the last 70k years. It is concretely misspent for Indian readers as he touches upon Hinduism and Indian history with a left-centered narrated philosophy."
Sapiens,Jayesh,Not worth,1,"Too lengthy, complex and confusing narration. Found it extremely difficult to even complete 1 or 2 pages at a stretch. Not worth at all."
Sapiens,HonestnEthical,"The book is awesome, but not this edition",1,"The book is awesome, but this edition printed by Replika paper has very poor quality(or no quality at all) that reading this edition is very disappointing."
Sapiens,Dinesh Kumar Pandey,Strong personal opinions disguised as science,1,"We get that an author cannot fit in all the events in a single compilation. However, very slyly cutting out the parts which don't suit the author's narrative and mentioning mere speculation which suits it without any proper sources with evidence. Disappointed."
Sapiens,DR NABIN KUMAR JIT,Missing pages,1,This book is missing 32pages from page 309 to 340 . This is found while reading the book. Please replace the book immediately.

Sapiens,Foley,Underlying Agenda --Ax to grind...,1,"If Harari would stick to history... --this could be a good book. Example: He has Barack Obama as a centerpiece in the book for his under lying reason/agenda. Harari's left wing, progressive opinions pervades large sections of the book. Example: he applauds American Democrats while dissing the Republicans and misrepresents their goals and agenda. From politics to race he has an ax to grind. Harari takes down the existence of a supreme being with equal gusto to his left wing views. If Your politics runs well left of left and you subscribe to an atheist's beliefs... --have a good read with a fellow traveler, --a part time 'historian' with an agenda."
Sapiens,Nikhil Bhamere,NOT A HISTORY BOOK,1,"When reading this book, consider it as fiction and not a history book. Everything in this book are just authors opinion.I have noticed many historical inaccuracies, many concepts are not interpreted correctly as they should be. This book is only a marketing gimmick and nothing else. I like the concept of this book, but it's not a single person's cup of tea."
Sapiens,Praveen Kumar,Not a worthy read.,1,"Felt, I wasted time in reading the book. Author was mostly oscillating around the points which he wants to project through the book regardless of the facts. Author's knowledge on basic historical facts are very much questionable. Seems the entire book was written on what the author thinks rather than what actually had happened."
Sapiens,Omkar,Is it really true History,1,The Author rarley mentions empires in indian continent and religions orignated in Indian continent. He purposefully skips the Indian revolution theories and trying to impose specific philosophies. This book is creatively designed to be ashemed on our on History.

Sapiens,Sidharth Shankar,Worthless reading for Indian subcontinent's,1,"Author have very poor knowledge about rich historical past of India. 3000-100BC. He have to read about Indus Velly Civilization. Worthless reading for Indian subcontinents. Just funney things he have compiled, so called reseach. I suggested, he have to visit India once, he will definitely feel ashamed about his very little knowledge about History."
Sapiens,Animesh,Opinionated - everyone has one. Nothing great!,1,There is a clear choice in where he is quoting his beliefs with scientific examples and chooses to state some assumptions hiding behind his so called truthful insights. Basically hes trying to prove a point at a very superficial level hiding behind a very strong plot pretending to be filled with scientific evidences.

I closed the book after 90 pages....and it stayed in shelf. Then I researched author's biography and it is compatible with above controversies."

Sapiens,Rudolph,"Sweeping conclusions that are well, too, sweeping",1,"It isn't Harari's sweeping conclusions alone that disturb, but his wilfully misleading tactic of mixing fact with fiction in what is clearly a work of nonfiction. Hararis materialist, sensory worldview pretends. It pretends to start with a slavish embrace of scientific fact, but winds up at a wildly speculative dead end. Harari's at his best when, on rare occasions, he doesn't deviate from proven history, anthropology. He summarizes better than most. If only he wasn't as whimsical with everything else. It is his frequently cavalier inferences from our still-hazy past, that make his insights about our chaotic-complex present, and his predictions about our still hazier future, doubly suspect."
Sapiens,Arvind,An Indophobic. Agenda writer with selective input.,1,"I have just finished your book sapiens, it is wonderful book with lot of new information presented in a very new way. But I have some questions- like what compels you to shy away mentioning India or the history related to India. Though reading your book I learnt that you have good knowledge about India still you shrewdly avoided mentioning about Bhim Betka caves which ranges from 40000 to 120000 years from present. Moreover you completely forgot to mention Narmada man who ranges 250000 yeas from present. There are much more which I can mention and can be much more what I wanted to know in the journey of knowing homo's. Very much disappointed from the agenda writers like you. But I know you'll keep this doing in your future endeavours also and people will keep on reading and praising you blindly on you selective and agenda writing."

The author knows nothing in reality and has just tried to present his illogical opinions which are of no use to anyone except his pocket which is getting heavier everyday just because of the hype around this book. Read some actual books about the history of humankind, and you'll surely know what am I talking about. For once, try reading Indian scriptures or about Indian culture and know what's real."

Sapiens,Chander shekhar sharma,Full of myths,1,Apps to humans is the biggest lie taught to us. Darvin baba also wrote in his book that what he was telling that based on just a theory. No evidence is there. But we blindly follow this theory. We named our oldest ancient scriptures as mythology and blindly follow modern science which have been continuously changing. Vedic knowledge never changes in course of time.
Sapiens,S. Kalyanaraman,"Yuval is an anti-Luddige, anti-Cultural history",1,"Fire gave us power. Farming made us hungry for more. Money gave us purpose. This is how Yuval Noah Harari summarises history of humankind in Sapiens. Harari should have confessed that he is an atheist and a communist who adores money as God, while portraying everything in culture which he calls history as negative. He should meditate to find his atman linking with paramatman, cosmic energy, instead of selective misreporting of culture as a biological phenomenon. He is a sensation-monger. Yuval is anti-Luddite who can see nothing beautiful in culture, the way living and non-living entities live in harmony. Yuval is anti-cultural history, out to continue adoring money."

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Kumar Rahul,It is always better late than never,5,"After long time here i'm going to review for 'THE MONK WHO SOLD HIS FERRARI' by Robin Sharma, more than a reading book is looking inside of the self. I regret for not reading in past even though brought it long back, in fact left in the middle. It is always better late than never. People in this age are striving hard day and night to improve the standard of living, which is subjected with materialistic need and gives short-lived joy. This book acquaints you with the whole-host of the techniques existing form the ages to improve standard of life which originates from the self and gives everlasting happiness. Reading this book, chapter-by-chapter is nothing but uncovering the self layer-by-layer and finally reaching to the nucleus of the self. Believe me, it does not tell you to sell your FERRARI/AUDI/BMW/HONDA CITY/blah- blah, but definitely tells you how to live with long lasting joy in this materialistic.... This book has all that we need, the teachings, all in a symbolic meaning, teaches us that we must cherish little - little joys that we have, rather than we go for materialistic pursuits. Because if we are solid from the inside, then the outwardly world that we'll see will reflect our inner self, as we see our reflection in every human being we interact with. A great story to impart the teachings as to tell us how we don't value our precious lives, which is given to us for self-realisation, but we waste on various petty things. So i will say, try it, experience it, feel it, &amp; it will change the way you exist world. Cheers"

This might lead the readers to shut the book down amidst reading. The thing that doesn't go well is you will get various repetitions. For example, you may find so many similarities in the chapter explaining the virtue of 'Master your mind' with that of 'Live with Discipline'. Lessons to be learnt - 1) Master Your Mind 2) Follow your Purpose 3) Practice Kaizen 4) Live with discipline 5) Respect your time 6) Selflessly serve others 7) Embrace the present"

To the point with relevant explanations. This book is mainly written as a conversation between the enlightened person with the learner. It teaches spirituality and zen in a very conceivable form which I loved since I am not into spiritual stuff yet I found it interesting. It is to the point and nicely written, you don't have to put your brain much into it to understand. Synopsis - Its a story of a middle-aged person who has everything Fame, Fortune and power but NO Happiness. He pursues a journey of self-discovery in the Himalayas and returns with a complete transformation of himself. Then he teaches those principles to his old friend. This conversation between them is the soul of this book. Verdict- It is MOTIVATIONAL, INSPIRATIONAL &amp; SPIRITUAL altogether. (highly recommended for everyone)"

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Heet,A Guiding Light to Fulfillment - 'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari' Book Review,4,"Robin Sharma's 'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari' is a concise yet powerful exploration of personal transformation and life fulfillment. Through the tale of Julian Mantle's spiritual awakening, Sharma imparts timeless wisdom and practical insights. The book distills complex ideas into actionable principles, encouraging readers to reevaluate their lives and pursue purpose and happiness.

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,SANDIP KUMAR SHAW,About the book,4,I have purchased my first hardcover self help book. Good in quality.it comes with a paper cover .after removing paper cover we got the actual hard cover in black colour . The title is written in silver colour which make it good to see.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,shyam,Dare your patience to complete the book,4,"Book quality is ok. You would need l9ts of patience to complete the whole book going through every line. As one could feel the lag and same concept would be repeated with different lines as one could easily pissed off or I could say you would defenitely need lot of patience. And it seems too silly how john asks julian for every line he says and this julian repeats the same with different words. The one who follows their own heart does not require to read this book as the whole story is about follwing our way and giving space to ourselves with spiritual teachings. At some stage, you would feel too lag and boring as the same meaning would be repeated for a whole chapter with different lines as it would be evident that author tries to add more lines but nothing. And also it is quite evident that tries to embed with vocabulary rather normal readable English. But there would few lines, one could highlight as dialogues for 40 or 20 page chapter. All the chapters seems similar conversation and one could easily lose control if they listen this conversation of john amd julian. But you could try to test your patience by setting a goal of completing this book. Myself completing this book with a chapter remained for now and would be completing by another two days and i would be happy to start a new journey with another book hoping that gives me pleasure. I dont touch Robin Sharma's book ever. I dont feel like writing these many lines but am literally convincing myself to be unapologetic for choosing this book."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Rkv,Good book,4,Good book
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Tanmay raj,The content,4," The media could not be loaded. Awesome book , get lot of skills when you own this book."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Subhadra Alluri,Lots of information. Keep your cup empty,4,"This book tells the story of Julian Mantle, a successful lawyer whose life goes out-of-balance. He then sets on a life-changing journey to discover powerful lessons that transform life. This personal development book has got a lot of information; a lot of lessons to implement in our lives. Julians friend John, says throughout the story that his cup is empty. But for me, remembering all that vast information was difficult. But the good thing is, the important points of the chapter are given as bulleted points at the end of each chapter. There are some really great quotations mentioned. It would be a good re-read as well. If you dont have time, just highlight your favorite quotes and, go back and read them for motivation. Success cannot be pursued; success ensues. It flows as the unintended byproduct of efforts concentrated in the direction of a worthy cause. You will always feel a little discomfort when you are installing a new habit. Its sort of like breaking in a new pair of shoes at first, its a little hard to wear them but soon they fit like a glove. The best amongst us get comfortable being uncomfortable. Be brave, and set no limits on the workings of your imagination. Never be a prisoner of your past. Become the architect of your future. It is quite an inspiring book. Implementing everything mentioned in the book doesnt seem quite possible. But yeah, we can surely change a few things in our lives. Every change counts."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Anjali Sharma (@reading_for_sanity ),Best self help book with practical techniques for life mastery,4,"The monk who sold his ferrari is a fable about fulfilling your dreams. Julian Mantle, a highly successful litigation lawyer sells everything he possesses after a heart attack which according to him is a calling to live a life more meaningful and he leaves in search for some 'answers' that he always wanted to seek. He comes to know of the sages of sivana who live in Himalays, India. Julian learns the secret of enlightened leaving from the sages in the form of a symbolic fable. He returns and shares all that he learned from the sages with his friend, John (and hence the reader). What is the fable, what does it symbolise, what is the secret of leading a life of eternal happiness? The book tells you all this and much more!!!! The book becomes interesting from the part the reader gets to know about the symbolic fable and the seven virtues. The language is easy and author restates the points that he wants to make when the chapter is about to end, so at the end of the book you literally remember all the major points and techniques of life mastery or self mastery. It is one of those rare books which leave you a better person when you put it down after finishing it. I recommend this book to every single soul on this earth."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Amazon Customer,Fantastic book and amazing read,4,"Some advice from Robin Sharma in the book.... 1. The secret of happiness is simple and reachable: we need to find out what we truly love to do and then direct all of our energy and focus towards doing it. Once we do this, abundance flows into our life and all our desires are filled with ease and grace. 2. We should Never forget the importance of living with exhilaration. Never neglect to see the exquisite beauty in all living things. Stay focused on your purpose. The Universe will take care of everything else. 3. Do The Things You Fear The Most because The Universe favors the brave. When you resolve to lift your life to its highest level, the strength of your soul will guide you to a magical place with magnificent treasures. 4. Time slips through our hands like grains of sand, never to return again. Those who use time wisely from an early age are rewarded with rich, productive and satisfying lives. 5. The most noble thing you can do is to give to others. Give it back to needy and society. Start focusing on your higher purpose and bigger reason to live and success."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Sourabh malviya,Good for how to know yourself.,4,"It is good book to know about yourself. To love yourself. In first fev pages you might feel boring but after the the actual story turn the whole things. It give you how you can live your life, how you getting you happiness. over-all it is amazing book."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Namaste Ji,I can understand why people love it,4,"I found the book to be a useful step-by-step guide to personal growth. The fable format helps to add interest to what could otherwise become a tiresome listing of all the good things we should be doing for ourselves but aren't. Although most of the principles dealt with can be found in countless other volumes on self-help, personal growth and spirituality, Sharma's way of putting it all together helps to keep one on track. And sticking to the straight and narrow is for me the most difficult aspect of becoming the person I want to be. I have a minor quibble with Sharma's treatment of fear. He ignores the fact that fear breaks down into two main types. The first is the healthy kind that keeps us out of the path of speeding trucks and the other is the kind of fear that, due to abuse or difficult upbringings or whatever, exists in our psyche as a chronic undertone of tension and anxiety that undermines our self-image and our relationships. Minor complaints aside, I feel that a careful reading of the book and an equally judicious application of it's principles will help anyone to find greater joy and freedom in their lives. Please hit the 'Yes' button if you find this review helpful it only takes a second of your precious time. Thanks"
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,ZUBAIR KHAN,Good Read.!,4,"Robin Sharma knows what he is talking about, He squeezed down the psychology of human mind and knowledge he possessed into a nice fable, which can be readable by anyone, not just those who love reading. It means, this books is not just meant for entertainment purpose, you can trust the knowledge you will get from this book, and you can apply it in your real life."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,MKM,There is sense to what Julian Mantle says..,4,"Just completed reading Robin Sharma's The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. The book has some meaningful tips for leading a contentful life. Much of the book is written in a conversational style between John, an aspiring lawyer and Julian Mantle who was a veteran successful lawyer who has had everything he wished for professionally yet found his life to be miserable and less happy. The articulation is that Julian Mantle let go off his career and went on a spiritual path of learning with the Sages of Sivana in Himalayas and shares what he learnt from there to John. The book has some good techniques on mastering your mind and thought processes, following a life with purpose, developing your self, living with discipline, mastering time and serving others to name a few broadly. However, one part I disliked is the shallow view of some words used especially in the context of the learnings from the past 5000 years. Here you'd find words like mantra, nirvana used inappropriately and in a fully anglicised version. If you have read the ancient books of India, you'd find even higher meaning to these. Overall, a good read."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,laxman singh,Just go for it,4,Must read
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,SarunUK,One of the must read !!!,4,"Author briefing about couple of points that can implement in our daily life for reshaping our thoughts and focus on our positive behavior. He teaches us to share our knowlege to others and also at the same time learn from our mistakes. This book would help us to start a new routine in our life by taking small steps to the success. I suggest you to buy 'Who will cry when you die' (another book written by Robin Sharma), mainly depicts the important points that one should follow in our daily life. Happy read :)"
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Sivaraman T,Ok type book,4,"Thought it will be amazing to read but struck in Chapter 1, from so many day. So once I am through Ill edit and write it again."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Sachin Agrawal,"Powerful, if you know how to use it!",4,"This book is certainly more than just a casual read. It is for someone who wants to improve his living, get rid of his worries &amp; negativity and lead an enriched life. But that said, despite the fact that it is an excellent book, I am a bit disappointed because I happened to have read 'How To Stop Worrying' by Dale Carnegie and I find that some/many things in this book are a direct lift-off from that book. That apart, it still is a very helpful and eye opening read. The last chapter for me won this book a 4 star from me."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Vaishnavi Saritha,An overly spiritual optimistic ride,4,Honestly it's a 4 for me. It's just too religious. I mean it's true we should be More focused about the spiritual gain much well material things do matter.I mean we could find a balance between the two. I'm not asking to be perfectly greedy but after all in our life we need money. You can't simply put food on the table by meditating and spiritual growth only. But spirituality is important too but this is too cliche. Considering me coming from a Hindu religious upholding I find it similar to certain speeches by extremely stereotypical gurus. But books like THINK AND GROW RICH and The Power of Subconscious Mind etc are much more compelling self help.Those books are more like believe everything is possible while this one is more like it's already written by someone else and is called fate. Wtf
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,sweta,Not worth buying,4,Not a good storytelling..seems to be fake..bad literature..I left reading this book after 12- 15 pages...
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Trilok K.,Nice,4,Nice book to read
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Palantir,Recommendation : Buy,4,"Robin Sharma is an author and motivational speaker and this book remains his magnum opus even though it was written more than a couple of decades ago. This book revolves around the life of a busy lawyer with a crazy schedule and the sole ambition of being even more successful who successfully transformed his own life. It teaches you some principles like to respect time, having purpose, be in present, things like that. There is nothing new in this book which you don't already know but it is still nice to read. Fluid writing, a catchy story and obviously helpful if you are upto it. Amazon service was great. Got the book in perfect condition and before the scheduled date of delivery."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,bibloism_i_a,Soothing read!,4,"Basically it's about a man who has a successful life, at least in the eyes of others, literally vanishing into thin air one day leaving all his assets and reputation behind to pursue something he was lacking, i.e., happiness, contentment, peace etc. . Highly recommended especially if you are looking for some motivation and that striving factor to move forward. It's a guarantee that at the end of your reading or even halfway through you will be feeling some kind of positive vibes"
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Sounak Chatterjee,Didn't like the fiction side of the book,4,"It's good and if someone follows the techniques mentioned can learn to live a more fulfilling and purposeful life. Not really liked the fiction side of it...the conversation between a lawyer and a monk who was once a litigator. Initially it starts of well as Mantle goes to India in search of living a meaningful life but then the night he shares his techniques, it continues till the last chapter."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Placeholder,Good,4,Very good book.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Capt G.,Good,4,A good reading to help you to control one's mind and attain inner peace. We have to make sincere and determined efforts to achieve results
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Placeholder,A must read book,4,"It's a great book about your attitude of life, many people recommend this ,I understood why , you can read your listen."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,ALLOY-Z,Satisfied,4,"This is a good book. The main purpose is to educate the readers about finding inner peace and harmony is more primary then frantically chasing wealth at the cost of your health and tranquility. Unlike many other spiritual books the lessons in this book are very practical and he gives a simple way of remembering all the lessons so that you are always on the right track. I must say some of these same lessons I still use daily even 5 months after reading this book. If you are a very frustrated, dissatisfied person I would certainly recommend this book though you must know that this does not go into details of the 'art of peaceful living'. It will only give you some handy advice. I suggest you read books by more foundational Christian or religious authors."

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Vanik Malhotra,Inspiring Read,4,Book does question your beliefs and shakes your quest for materialistic goals but in the end it doesnt fail to re align outlook towards life.

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Nisarg,"Old wine in new bottle, but this bottle is stupendous.",4,"Frankly speaking, I didn't find any new concepts here. All that is discussed in it was quite familiar to me. If you also come from family background where religious or philosophical debates often take place then you too will feel the same. But the treatment given by the Robin Sharma to the whole age-old subject is superb. The way he builds the story to convey the philosophy, existing since antiquity, is excellent. So I strongly recommend this book and it's worth reading."

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Sambhav Kumar,Genuine review with 360 view along aspects,3,"I'll genuine review about both postive and negative with ultimate voice whether to buy it or not. My easy review to help you understand it better. Postive: Finest story telling art of author Robin Sharma, he told every single line in such a way that you will feel in place like the main character of the story I.e Julian Mantle and John. Very well written and readers friendly, authors narrate story and techniques so that readers can easily relate it and understand. Thus book will lead you towards abundance of basic principles for self mastery. Main thing is that you will find in a new life experience while reading this book and I bet on this. Negative: Author derives common way of techniques for self improvement which most of people already aware of but nobody's follow. However various new things come in your way to aware you and let you up in a prioritised world. That sensation may lit fire within you. So drawback is if you're reading to only find techniques then it's not for you because you may can find them anywhere on internet as a summary. But if you wanna go to relish the taste of imaginary world, beautiful art of friendship and importance of life with several examples then go for it. Book is also cheap and affordable sobi would suggest you to buy it and finish it because it won't take much effort to finish it and learn some new ways of writing with creative thinking.. Rest upto you cause I can't tell much at least the book will speak for itself. Just read and read masteblaster creative and story life of Julain mantle the leading character. You will feel like in heaven. Best of luck and I hope my review will save or worth your single penny. Good luck. Note: Read some glimpse of the books which I've enclosed here to take grasp of new life and positivity."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,GMS,Good book,3,"I read self help books in general, this book is all same, but we've few learnings, so it is worth it."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Atul damani,Motivational but the content and context is very much paradoxical!,3,"A morbid fat man with a heart condition sells his ferrari and everything (what he does with the money is mystery), as i guess no body told him to participate in any motivational seminar or coaching and hence he goes to India. Climbs himalaya (a fat man with heart condition climbs himayala, without any issues) to search for inner harmony and peace...yeah! The story doesn't tell any extraordinary stuff, it's the same old motivational stuff which is available in any other self help book! Writer claims that the techniques are 5000 years old, centuries old, were followed by sages, ancestors etc. but without solid base and justification! The techniques are yes worth exploring but the way the scenerios and fable has been portrayed, it is far fetched, illogical, and paradoxical for ex..talks about sleeping early and getting up early but sharing the same wisdom midnight! The writing is so monotonous that it doesnt feel like one to one conversation but a person imagining and writing for both! A monk who doesnt believe in material things has diamond path in his most important part of fable! But still on a positive note, the techniques will make you feel motivated. It will ignite the spark to make you think about your life and choices.."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,DAVID R.,Some pages are missing and some are repeated,3,Pages 143 to 147 are missing Pages 147 to 154 are repeated
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Yahya Ahmed,Overhyped,3,"The author describes a story of lawyer turned monk If you are a new reader /beginner, this might be a good read..but for people who have read some self help books in the past... there's nothing mind blowing or interesting ...Just some usual life rules are woven in a form of a story...with tons and tons of adjectives in each sentence.. If you think you still wanna read Robbin Sharma Go for 5am club..i personally have joined the 5am club"
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,anitha,Good,3,Good
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Payel,Didn't match my expectation. Overhyped book.,3,Heard a lot about this book. But did not fulfill my expectation. It is overhyped book according to my perspective. I feel like it is from the view point of a westerner to the Hindu mythology which revolves around the mystics of Himalayas. Does not feel anything real. He want to propagate people through current status of life in the westernised countries. For that he has built up an imaginary world that fills like swarg but which does not exist in reality. I didn't find anything meaningful in the initial pages. He has drag the story too much with repetitive lines. I don't feel motivated after reading this book. The review is completely from my experience which may not match with other people. I feel like I have wasted the money by buying this book.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Pushkar,Good 101 book on enlightened living,3,"Maybe im too late in reading this book. Should have read it in 2000 along with the book alchemy. But have read many such books since and this appears basic in comparison to Tony Robbins, Power of Now, Atomic Habits. Even his latest books are better, the 5AM club - but again, some may find it repetitive. My summar - its better than reading nothing."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Rajesh Shankar,Good work of Fiction - But need to read and get inspired by true accounts,3,"Well, Only after I brought this book, I came to know that this is a Fable, means a work of fiction. Although, I don't underrate this book as the volume of sales over the years speak the value of the book, however, matters pertaining to self-realisation, spiritual quest etc are more effectively described by the real time experience of Sadhaks who have personally undertaken the path. I would rather recommend people to put money their money and time in reading real time experiences by 'Radhanath Swami', 'Paramhansa Yoganada', 'Swami Vivekananda', 'Ramkrishna Paramhansa', 'Om Swami', 'Swami Kriyananda'. Some of the must read are The journey home - by Radhanath Swami If truth is to be told - Om Swami The autobiography of a Yogi - Parmhansa Yogananda The new Path - Swami Kriyananda"
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Placeholder,Amazing book by Robin Sharma... Terrible binding,3,This is a must read book for everyone who's seeking happiness in their lives. The binding quality was just awful. It just fell apart before I finished reading it. Hence the rating.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Zeeshan Ali Naqvi,"Interesting and definitely worth reading, but a little monotonous.",3,"It is worth reading, a nice self help book. It does get a little monotonous, the conversation between Julian and John, with John understanding and agreeing to everything Julian was saying. I can understand it must be to keep the story simple and to convey the message, but sometimes it made the story a little boring. I loved the parts where Julian shared his experiences as part of stories, rather than commandments."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Mr.DarkSider,Good Read - But Would Recommend To One Who Already Have Accumulated Riches To Do These.,3,"Not That Much Applicable To One Who Is Just Starting Career. As Advices / Steps Given In Order To Keep Calm &amp; Live Healthy - Happy Life, Could Not Be Applied Directly To The Problems That Comes In Early Career."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Sravani,Honest review,3,Compared to this 'The Alchemist ' book was super good. The Alchemist book narration is like a story and you will get more intrest. But ' the monk who sold is Ferrari ' Is like a preaching to me. Every line you have to mark. And after some time I feel some bore. But so many people like this. But to me 'Alchemist' is best as compared to this one.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Ayana Bhatt,Quality of product was nice.,3,"I liked the product quality. But personally it was not appealing for me, basically the coversations were too long between the two. If we see it completely, it's not practical and it gets boring sometime. But it has changed so many peoples's life, so i guess every books leaves a different imapct on everybody."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Amazon Customer,Pages not good !,3,"The book didn have very good pages..looks like a fake book..the texture of the page fails to satisfy an avid reader..the only purpose one buys an original novel, rather a fake one..Not very satisfied !"
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Kei,Enchanting Fable about Destiny,3,"I am a sucker of 'fantasy novels' but this book really lured me into another genre that i never even thought of getting into. Coming to this book, the story is captivating and hard to put down. The only thing i disliked about it is the repetition of things over and over despite of being a small book. In a nutshell, it is an enlightening book and should be read atleast once by everyone."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Sadhana Barman,Ok ok,3,Very boring book. First half of the book was boring as it was revolving around the topic and repeating the same thing again and again. You need to have patients to read this book because it becomes interesing after second half. I liked 'who will cry when I die ' instead. It's a very nice book
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Purnesh Shrivastava,Not upto mark,3,Poor quality. Not original Print. Pathatic Binding &amp; Paper quality.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Ashish's,Good Book but heighly over rated.,3,This book revels the tricks which we must follow. But some time while reading i noticed that the points were not clear. Though the message of the book is how to improve yourself by learning some simple trick which is used by Yogis.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Rohan kumar,Condition was not good.,3,I don't like the condition of book it was just seems as like as library book may be used at book store. It was not look like new.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Abhishek,Not delivered in mint condition,3,"I'm no critic of books. So, I won't focus on what's written inside. But the condition of book is not so great. I cannot keep this masterpiece in my shelf and that's sad."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Agzghabanmaysnsnamzon Czbjsjsjxnmsmaustomerbsjj,"Its a good read, exceptional as a timepass",3,"Its a good read, exceptional as a timepass. However, if you are looking to change your life, it falls short. If you believe in sprituality and are a theist, then this book may help you, but for a critical thinker and skeptic like me, this book is nothing more than fiction. Most of the techniques are impractical, and there is blatant misinformation about brain and science. There are instances of promotion of other books which was a shock to me."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Darshan,"Quotes, Quotes and Quotes",3,The book is good but some of the chapters I don't like. Writer has written down the same quotes everyone speaks nowadays - 'find your passion' and all that. Writer has made this book a collection of life changing quotes which one can find on any self help website. However the form of story the writer used to convey his message is outstanding.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,adij,Good book,3,"Good book, should read if u feel ur life not going well or keep the things on track Go and read it."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Ritick Verma,You can go for other books,3,"I purchased it as it is so highly rated. But I found it boring and repetitive. There are many other books which you can read. In my opinion, you can skip it "

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,tonamie,a bit cliched,3,don't get the hype
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Amit Mondal,... It is not a book for those who are happy with life,3,"First of all I want to let you know that It is not a book for those who are happy with life. If you are in a very bad phrase of life then you must know how to be happy with this book. Secondly I truly believe that none can achieve the secret of life in just 7 months, it is impossible. I think this story needs improvement."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Tina g.,Okish. Sure does teach us how to be content. Not applicable in real life.,3,Too many things to do.not a path a normal or mango people can follow.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Amazon Customer,Book looks like its straight outta factory to my lap. So clean and punctual delivery,3,"Gotta give 5 stars for delivery. Book isn't for fiction lovers. It's all about those millionaire turn into a sage, and some FAQs between his former sidekick"
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Tanushree Karmakar,I have had dreams and I have had nightmares. I overcame the nightmares because of my dreams.,3,The message this book conveys is actually very strong and life changing no doubt. But this lacks a tight story line. After a while it becomes very predictable and do not engage you if you are not a devoted reader.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,MR,Over rated and boring.,3,It seems inspirational in the begining but gets overly boring as you go on reading. I felt so exhausted that I it mid-way and I NEVER leave a book unfinished you can imagine how over-rated this book is! Just cultivate positive thinking and do not let sadness over power you. Always be hopeful and thankful and expect good. That's the mantra of a happy life. Saved you some bucks there!
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Divyanka,Motivational but...,3,This book is great for those who have lost their path in life and list motivation but for normal people its a bit boring.It would attract you at first reading all those awesome motivational lines but soon they would become common and you would lose interest... Its NOT AT ALL suited for all ages. For Children and teens like me -Its total boring but I think it would help a little to the middle ages. But the book is beautifully written :D
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,AN,An ok book,3,I found this a little boring. But totally depends on what you are looking to find in this book.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Satyam R.,Dissatisfactiory paper quality,3,"Can't find words to describe the greatness of the book. But meant of us have a habit to write meaning of the words popping while reading, so it will be better off they improve the paper quality"
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Osho Kabir,Good for the Readers but Dangerous for the beginners,3,"After reading this I feel that some points and exercises are written very good in the book, but at the same time the meditation techniques which are described here by the Monk are the Techniques given by Shiva to Parvati 10,000 years ago are wrongly explained here in the book. So, it can create some big problems with your Mind and Subconconciousness and as u know mind is a very delicate structure. But for the Readers.....This is a Beautiful Novel."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Kindle Customer,Decent !,3,Slightly Repititive content nd theme from author New subject would be good Otherwise interesting ! Looking for more innovative content
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Rahul Verma,An okay book..,3,"When i first saw the cover i was looking for a book with some of the fiction relating to motivation and real world examples instead what i get was literature in its niche sense. The book is okay, but it's a tough read for the people who can't find their motivation by reading like me. It's an average book with an awful lot of text on the techniques to lead a healthy and happy life through some simple strategies etc."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,shasha,not meant for avid reader,3,This book repeats same old story told by many in a different back drop with easy to understand language not meant for avid reader who has read lot more before
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Rohan,"Great, inspiring book.",3,"Great, inspiring book. Helped me learn a lot, the ways to live, understand and appreciate each aspect of life. Re-read soon to follow. Although, the whole book felt like an Interview. It felt like the author just wanted an intro story to fit the whole concept/teachings."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Vishal Rangadiya,R.E.V.I.E.W by just a reader.,3,"Quality: pages are yellowish BIG disappointment. Delivery : On time as always by Amazon. Book : A book to learn to achieve something, don't only read BUT learn.."

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Adityaa,The Preachy monk,3,"The problem with this book is its pacing, preachy attitude, and positivity.

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Azaz,I found it over-rated,3,"I don't want to criticize the book, but I feel that if you are from rural India or don't live a hectic life schedule, you may find yourself skipping lines and paragraphs just cause it has way too much of explanation.

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,SMNKB,Summary of the book (from my point of view):,2,"Book was in perfect condition when I received it. The Amazon team did a good job by delivering it on time. I give the two stars to them. Just my opinion: I did not like the book though. What I expected to be philosophical and inspiring turned out to be a fairy tale (maybe more immature than that) for kids. The 'monk' of the story came across mystical sages who lived in the mountains in houses made of beautiful flowers. No other support like bricks, clay or straw roof. I lost my interest right there. I wondered how the narrator was able to listen to the 'monk' (his ex-boss) with great interest even after a tiring day. Maybe he wanted a promotion? The story was so unrealistic that the magical, inspiring part and the real world drama could not come out together."
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Manohar,Each page letter was missed. Refer example photo.,2,Each page letter missed. Printing quality is low. Unable to read.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Subhrangsu Bose,Not fit for a teenager,2,"A teenager looking for motivation, this definitely isn't for you. The writer can't expect people to just get 'motivated' and 'inspired' by blurting out random philosophical teachings of great sages. He might be factually correct, but his storytelling is way off. It started as a novel, but the book ended up being a total disaster by shifting its base to a philosophical regime, a transition that was although obvious, wasn't smooth at all."

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Palaniappan A,Not worth reading........,2,"I guess it is art of writing rather than revealing something from Himalaya and all. Till end of the book the author did not reveal anything on how to lead a balanced life. The idea is simple, the author want to say live simple and live for the wholesome, live to know who you are .....but then I used to wonder how one can drag the above message for 200 odd pages without reveling anything. He keep saying the about concept in different format throughout the book. Not sure whether one need to buy this book. I probably would not recommend this to my friends."

It involves only 2 guys talking throughout and you will be bored after few pages. I really has some outstanding principles but it was not linked to good examples. Throughout the book Robin sharma stresses you on waking up at 5 am, going to gym, spend time with family and the cycle repeats in every chapter. The good book should make you laugh, feel pity, cry and that impact should last at least for a week. That piece is missing in this book. But i was really touched when Julian talks about his family and especially his beautiful daughter."

I thought I was reading an elementry school kid's essay. Great ideas, should have pitched them to an actual writer who could have developed a story. Here's what you're in for: (quoted from page 90) 'I still have much wisdom to share with you. Are you tired?' 'Not in the least. I actually feel pretty pumped up. You are quite the motivator, Julian. Have you ever thought about an infomercial?' I asked mischeviosly. 'I don't understand,' he replied gently. Was the book written by a 10 year old, I pondered sincerely..."

The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,Achhantea,Overrated book. Futile.,1,"I wish I could give this book -1 star. I bought this book, that is so overrated. This book has gotten so many great reviews, because most of the readers of this book are Indian. This book promotes Hinduism, Hindu culture, yoga, being a vegetarian (I'm not saying those are bad, but it is really lame). And it tells you the same thoughts over and over again, really boring. I was also trying to read 'who will cry when you die' written by the same author, definitely not now. The title and market tactics fooled me. Page 59, last paragraph. 'Even if you feel don't like it, look in the mirror and laugh for a couple of minutes'. Really, are you kidding??? That's pretending. Fakeness."

For xyz reasons I couldn't get myself to read these authors when somebody suggested this book. So I bought this for my 16 yr old nephew, he too flipped through this book, so predictable, monotonously classroomish lecturing, and pathetic attempt to kindle ones imagination. I have no idea how this and similar to these have become best sellers, it's a consolidation of western ideologies and sugar coating them in the Himalayas and selling it wrapped in the name of ancient jewels. Sorry, I probably could just go on. Not for people who have been avid readers."

People that read Self-Help are the same people that fall victim to babas and spiritual gurus. It's the same kimda people trying to get their life together and these Self-Help books, all they do is give you hope whilst also blame you for your depression and sorrow saying 'you have a weak mind or you dont think right'.
