Have tried many brands over the last couple of years and I would say this one is among the best I have tried. These almonds are fresh, big and tastes good even after you soak them in water for 8 hours (you know why it is good to soak almonds overnight...) and price is reasonable too. Should give it a try and you won't feel sorry."

Happilo California Dried Almonds,Arun Vedha Raneesh,Quality is good...,4,"When I ordered it. I was afraid of the quality.. but, fortunately,the quality is good . Some seeds had damages in the skin .. otherwise it is good I slightly doubt the quantity. Because, it doesn't weigh 5000grams.. it seems less.. have to verify it . The taste is good and crunchy.. One negative mark is that,the price is higher than retail shops .. otherwise, worthy purchase...as far as my concern goes"
Happilo California Dried Almonds,Navdeep Singh,Good size almonds with nice quality but a bit dry,4,"The almonds from happilo are above average in size and definitely fresh. The taste is good as well but they could have more oil for supposed California almonds. Some are oily while others feel a bit dry for such high priced almonds. Overall, given the price I bought them for in the sale, they are almost value for money. Will give these a 4 stars out of 5. Will be updating the review after we have used them for a few weeks and the pack is almost empty wrt the consistency of the quality for the entire pack."
Happilo California Dried Almonds,Madhavan,"Good Quality Almonds for the Price, but Packaging Needs Improvement",4,"Review: This is the sixth time Ive purchased the Happilo 100% Natural Premium California Almonds. I continue to choose this product mainly because it offers decent quality at a reasonable price. However, there are some drawbacks worth mentioning. Pros: Affordable cost with acceptable quality for this price range. Most of the almonds are fresh. Cons: 1.In some of the packets, I noticed that a few almonds were soft rather than crunchy, which affected the consistency of the product. 2. The packaging needs improvement. The plastic zip on the pouch tends to come apart after a couple of uses, so I recommend transferring the almonds to another container for longer storage. Rating: I would rate this product 4 stars due to the issues mentioned, particularly the packaging. Overall Conclusion: For the price, this is a decent option. If youre looking for extreme quality and are willing to spend more, other brands may offer a more consistent experience."

Happilo California Dried Almonds,Vijay,Disappointing Quality: Happilo 100% Natural Premium California Dried Almonds (500g),3,"The almonds were priced at Rs.300+, which was lower than the Rs.500+ I usually pay at local stores. However, upon opening the pouch, I was hit by a strong, unpleasant odor that wasn't reminiscent of fresh almonds. I soaked them overnight as instructed, hoping it would improve the taste, but unfortunately, the off-putting odor and a strong rancid flavor persisted. The almonds also lacked the satisfying crunch I expect from quality almonds."

The stock I received are totally insipid, substandard, tiny products. They don't taste anything like almonds. Tasteless! I contacted Amazon for returning them they saying I need to contact the manufacturer. And the customer care representative who was assigned to resolve my issue falls under the category of the worst type of customer service provider. Instead of providing resolution to the issue he was handling he was repeatedly saying - 'Would there be anything else apart from this we may assist you with?' How disgusting it that! I was not even provided a proper resolution due to such unethical customer care representative. Shame! Don't buy the Happilo almonds or any of their products as their quality has gone down drastically over time. Don't pay your hard earned money for substandard products."

Happilo California Dried Almonds,Madan Pal,"Order for Happilo 100% Natural Premium Californian Almonds Value Pack Pouch, 500 g",1,"Quite perplexing. Ordered 500 g price Rs 469/- on 16.12.20 but received 2 packs of 200 g each on 20.12.20 . Also price of this product (500 g) on 21.12 20 shows Rs. 437/- only. Feels quite bad about this purchase. P.S.: After writing and submitting above review, I opened the inside packet, which is found to have one more (third) packet containing 200 g of roasted almonds,. This was not expected but any way loss of 100 g and price has been adequately compensated. Accordingly above (first) review need not be acted upon. Inconvenience if any is regretted."

Tata Salt,Nazish Laeiq,the brand's commitment to quality and trustworthiness,4,"Tata Salt's Vacuum Evaporated Iodised Salt is a must-have in my kitchen. As a health-conscious individual, I always prioritize the quality and purity of the ingredients I use in my cooking, and Tata Salt meets my expectations. The vacuum evaporation process used in its production ensures that the salt is free from impurities, making it a reliable and safe choice for my family's health. I appreciate that it is iodised, which means it provides the essential iodine needed for healthy thyroid function. The fine texture of the salt dissolves quickly, allowing it to blend seamlessly into my meals. The convenient packaging makes it easy to use and store, and the brand's commitment to quality and trustworthiness further reassures me of its reliability. Tata Salt has earned my trust as a high-quality salt option, and I highly recommend it to anyone who values purity and health in their cooking."

You can order this on Monthly basis I found that there is no measurement for give appropriate amount of food. You have to check Manually. Product Update after 5 months 1.I started Royal Canin to my pet because pedigree is not helping to improve her health so i started Royal canin &amp; mixing it with pedigree in 1:1 Ratio so this will be cost efficient &amp; good for pet health also so far pedigree is not great so much but not worst at all as per my experience!!"

My labrador has also become more chubby :) . I use this with wet food or cerelac ."
Pedigree Puppy Food,Ravi Shekar,Timely delevery & wonderful packing.,5,"Packing was good, Product freshness was intact.no punctures to the packet and delevered at correct time. I have tried royal canine and drools focus previously. Even the Royal canine is good, it was expensive and out of my budget so used it only till 3 months. Drools focus dosent show much results even at its premium price than a drools normal or pedigree. My rottie had skin allergies when using drools focus. I had only buy that seeing &lt;30% meat in it and no grain or fillers. But turned out to be no good. So when shifted to pedigree allergies were gone slowly and my rottie looks wonderful now. Dont believe in 'corn as filler' rumers, corn is actually beneficial for dogs as per recent studies. And if you want to feed your dog a raw meat diet then do it but opting a kibble which got a high meat content is actually useless and proves unworthy. Pedigree has been fed to millions of pets around the world safely. So go for it with out a doubt."

Pedigree Puppy Food,Vivek,My 8 puppies are suckers for this!,5,"I don't know what does this product have in it but puppies go crazy when they smell it. My puppies are just a month old, all of them and I was apprehensive it they could eat something hard and crispy as they had never eaten whole foods before but they seem to have taken a liking for it and munch on it like there is no end. Also, my dog is a first time mom and this product really helped when she did not want to feed them milk. I did not really have to put any effort in it, it draws them organically. Also, it has a great smell, so may be that is what makes them happy and crazy. Verdict - Must buy if you have puppies who are not getting enough food because of whatever reasons!"

If you invest in early days in puppies growth later you would not have to worry about what you give him.

Soan Papdi,Jiffy,Liked it,4,"The soan papdi from Bikano is tasty, rich in aroma. It melts in mouth as expected. It tastes little bit more sweet than expected. If they could reduce the sweetness and add more flaky texture like soan papdi usually has, it will become even tastier. You can go for it."
Soan Papdi,Saurabh,Tasty,4,Yummy
Soan Papdi,Placeholder,"Good quality and tasty too, but.....",4,"Bikano Soan Papdi tastes delicious and the quality of ingredients used are good, but the mithai has no 'structural integrity', to use a civil engineer's language, because of which the excessively soft and crumbly mithai breaks up on touch, forcing you to pick up bits and pieces of the mithai instead of a whole piece, which is very inconvenient to eat and impossible to offer to guests, who will immediately conclude that a half eaten piece of Soan Papdi is being offered to them! However, if you want to offer Bikano Soan Papdi to super senior citizens of over 75 years of age, go ahead and order this mithai without a second thought, because this is the best mithai for toothless elders and kids under 6 years of age! Not joking! Order a box of Bikano Soan Papdi and check it out on the elders and kids in your house and neighbourhood! They will love it!"

Unlike polished dals that may lose some essential nutrients during processing, this unpolished toor dal retains its natural goodness, making it a rich source of protein, fiber, and essential vitamins. 2. Authentic Taste and Aroma: The Tata Sampann Toor Dal boasts an authentic taste and delightful aroma that enhances the overall flavor of the dishes I prepare. It adds a delectable earthy and nutty note to traditional Indian recipes like dal tadka and sambhar. 3. Easy to Cook: The dal cooks evenly and to a perfect consistency in no time. Soaking it for a short period reduces cooking time further, making it a convenient choice for busy days. 4. Quality Packaging: The 2kg packaging is robust, ensuring the dal remains fresh and free from any contaminants. The zip lock feature allows for easy storage after each use. 5. Health Benefits: I have noticed a positive impact on my digestion and overall well-being since incorporating this dal into my diet. The high fiber content aids in digestion, and the protein content keeps me satiated for longer periods. Cons: Honestly, I cannot think of any significant drawbacks to this Tata Sampann Unpolished Toor Dal. It has consistently delivered on taste, nutrition, and ease of use. In conclusion, the Tata Sampann Unpolished Toor Dal has become a household favorite for its quality, authenticity, and nutritional value. It has become an essential part of my kitchen, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to add a healthy and flavorful touch to their meals. With its excellent taste and numerous health benefits, this dal has truly earned its place as a staple in my pantry."

Value For Money:-Yes it's a value for money product as it's quality &amp; taste is better then other brands... Comparison:-If we compare it with other vermicelli brand then it's very good due to good flavor,low price and I also feel that it's a quality is better which is a good point... Final Thoughts Or Review:-According to me if you want a budget friendly vermicelli,fine quality vermicelli and which will provide you a very good flavor then you should consider this...."
MTR Vermicelli,Bala,Deceptive Packaging,3,"Both the 'Roasted Vermicelli' and the unroasted 'Seviyan Vermicelli' are sold on deceptively similar red &amp; blue primary packs. For a modest priced item, an online buyer will save time in preparation, if you look at the pack carefully before adding it to the cart. MTR is a big enough firm to have two distinctly different packs for Roasted and Unroasted Vermicelli."

Maggi,niceguy,There is no taste left in this maggi anymore,1,"Whenever I try to give this one a chance, it disappoints me. The quantity is less. Tastemaker masala is less and tasteless. I have to add my own curmin, coriander and lots of chilli along with butter to make it eatable. Nestle is cleverly trying to push us into buying 20 rupees masala maggi and they still want to keep this tasteless thing alive so that there is a differentiator price and taste wise and given that the quality and taste of this maggi is so bad, buyers will try to justify the purchase of 20 rs maggi because they think at least that is tasty!!! There are so many better brands available in 12 rs range. They not only give lots of masala and also add a sachet of tasty oils to go with the noodles. May be its time to switch to those brands."
Lipton Green Tea,Akshay Vekariya,Refreshing Green Tea Experience,5,"I bought and tried this green tea two months ago and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and result. As a green tea lover, I'm always on the lookout for a good green tea, and this one exceeded my expectations. The taste is smooth and well-balanced; however, it could be better with a very light flavor. It has very high-quality green teas. The most enjoyable part was the absence of any bitter aftertaste, which can sometimes be an issue with other brands. It's evident that the leaves are of premium quality, resulting in a clean and refreshing cup of tea. Consuming for more than two months helped me balance my weight and be energetic. I appreciate the clear instructions provided on the packaging. I highly recommend it to fellow tea lovers looking for a high-quality green tea option."

Lipton Green Tea,Prof. K Bhowmick,Awesome product.... Lipton pure and light green tea is Awesomely good,5,"Lipton pure and light green tea is a wonderful product of Hindustan Unilever Limited. As you know green tea content large amount of antioxidant and it helps us to relief from stress and helps us to feel energetic throughout the day. I got this product at a very discounted price on Amazon India the product was delivered to me within 4 days after ordering. Packaging of the product was good. I ordered Lipton pure and light Green Tea during the super value days. I am from Durgapur city which is in West Bengal. I heard about green tea and today I am using this green tea as my stress reliever. There are 25 packets of green tea each of the packets is seal in a mini plastic air tight packet. When you want to take green tea you have to cut that plastic pouch and take out that green tea bag and have to dip in hot water few minutes and after that you can drink that green tea, green tea is enjoyed without sugar and milk. I will strongly recommend this product everyone should try again it at least once and Lipton green tea is really awesome. But do not take green tea more than 2 times daily."

Lipton Green Tea,Vinayak SP,Got tea bags in just Rs.370/-+10% SBI CASHBACK at https://amzn.to/39WLDaA,5,"Got tea bags in just Rs.370/-+10% SBI CASHBACK at https://amzn.to/39WLDaA Excellent packing, super fast delivery. This is my third flavor of Lipton tea and personally, I feel good about this product..... Zero demerits except some taste issues vary from person to person.... but it will get adjusted after 2-3 servings. Great product. Price is lower than the market price, thanks to Amazon. Studies show green tea is good for health.. prevents cancer, promotes weight loss, reduces inflammation, helps in memory boost, and good sleep.

Nice packing. Thanks again, Amazon. Regarding flavor, I have tried Tulsi, Mint, and now Honey. My personal favorite is Mint!!!"

Lipton Green Tea,Pune reviewer,Subtle and effective,4,First impression: For the first time it feels odd. But this changes within 2 days of use. It feels good to drink the green tea. If you want strong cup of tea then take less water and vice versa for a lesser strong tea. Overall it is usable. Good to start with. You can continue discovering different tea brands till the time you find that perfect tea. This is also cost effective approximately 3.5 per tea cup. go with smallert pack. You can then order more in case it fits your taste.

Lipton Green Tea,Placeholder,Not green tea,1,"I have been drinking green tea for the last 8/9 year. In those years, I have tested products from several brands, including this specific brand. This was my third or fourth purchase of Lipton green tea on Amazon. While I had good experiences with earlier products, this specific order really baffled me. This is ABSOLUTELY not green tea; it doesn't taste like green tea, it doesn't look like green tea. While green tea, when brewed, gives off a pale yellow colour, this one releases a reddish (the colour of normal black tea) colour. If you brew green tea for more than 2/3 minutes, it releases its bitter notes; however, this specific product from Lipton doesn't do that even if you brew for 15 minutes. Another aspect of green tea is that it takes a little time (around 2 minutes) to brew, but put a tea bag of this particular product, the water is instantly red. (See pictures). What is confusing to me is that the earlier orders of this same product were absolutely ok. What happened to this one, did they put normal tea in packets marked as 'Pure &amp; Light Green Tea'? I don't know. But I am done with Lipton."
Lipton Green Tea,Sravya,Clear & Light - Bad taste,1,Pure &amp; Light version of Lipton green tea used to taste good. Recently I have bought this Clear &amp; Light version from Lipton. The taste is so bad and all my family members felt like puking due to some kind of shampoo smell that spoiled the taste. Please stop production of Clear &amp; Light and produce Pure &amp; Light only.
Lipton Green Tea,Sameer,Stapler pins in tea bags,1,"The Better India INDIA, INFORMATION Knew Stapler Pins in Tea Bags Are Banned? FSSAI Bans You Should Know About by Vidya Raja May 15, 2019, 4:55 pm 1. Stapler pins in tea bags Tea Bags Source: Wikimedia Commons Do you remember seeing the tea bag stapled in the recent past? If yes, then you can write to the FSSAI and lodge a formal complaint. In July 2017, a circular was issued by the FSSAI banning tea manufacturers from using stapler pins in tea bags. The circular read, Taking cognisance of the risk to public safety in using staple pins in tea bags by some FBOs, the Food Authority in exercise of the power conferred under Section 16 (5) of FSS Act, 2006, hereby directs the concerned FBOs to discontinue the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale, and import of stapled tea bags by January 1, 2018."
Lipton Green Tea,Amazon Customer,It's no longer pure green tea but flavoured green tea,1,"I have loved this green tea for its taste for years. It has always been a five star product for me, but now this is no longer 'pure' green tea but 'flavoured' and calling it 'refreshing new taste' . I would rate it negative five stars if I could. Now I have to go about trying other green tea brands. Thinking of trying Twininings green tea. Hope that will be good."

I always drink lipton green tea n have a good idea of quantity of tea n also of sachet. It is non returnable. Because of lockdown I got my parcel after 20 days but it doesn't matter. The matter of concern is quantity n taste which is too bad. Totally disappointed from this seller."
Lipton Green Tea,Satan,Don't fall for the marketing,1,"It is not natural but flavored tea. Any tea bag tea would be full of tea dust instead of whole leaves. You won't be able to have good brew because there won't be space for tea dust to open up. Good teas tastes good, and they do not require flavoring which Lipton teas falls short, if you are new to green tea world, this is the worst tea you can buy for your money. Now, lets calculate the cost, this tea would cost you 977 INR for 250 grams, a very high price for a low quality tea in India, search for whole leave green tea, especially Darjeeling and you would have great taste and quality tea for less price than this. I know its garbage because I had started my green tea journey with Lipton tea bags and its been years since I have green tea everyday."

NutroVally Chia Seeds,Anita P.,Full of tiny Stones !,1,The bottle of chia seeds was full of tiny stones and caused lot of pain while chewing the overnight soaked chia seeds. Worst quality.
NutroVally Chia Seeds,N singh,Don't waste your money,1,Just don't purchase this product. Better to buy chia seeds from other company. Used only once and will never use it again. Bought this for my mom but it has many dust or soil particles which get settled below when soaked. It's just a health hazard
