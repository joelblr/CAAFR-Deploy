OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Ishan Sehgal,"Budget friendly 5G phone under 20,000",5,"Battery backup is so good . It can last up to above 1 day if the user has normal usage like social media apps and Content watching apps like YouTube Facebook Netflix Instagram. Smoothness of the Screen is very good . Day to day use is very good . User should not feel any lag . 5G Connectivity is very helpful. Apps takes less time to download, they download very fast. Call quality is superb , Clear and high quality sound when calling to someone if person is indoor or outdoor. In both condition multimedia and call quality is. But camera is okkish I must say not too good not very bad . ok ok . Black colour is good from my point of view if want to purchase this mobile . Battery Call quality and screen smoothness is top notch in this price segment. If want to purchase this mobile I must say you should go with that . Specially if person wants good battery backup and sound quality. Rest every person has its own choice and budget. It is my First ONE PLUS purchase. I am using it from last 20 days I have not feel any Heating issue. Because i have said I am not heavy user that why I have not feel any Heating of laggs. Phones comes with 80 Watts vooc charger which charges the phone very fast."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Jatin,Excellent,5,"The OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G is a popular mid-range smartphone that balances affordability with some great features. Heres a look at its unique pros and cons: Pros: 1. Affordable 5G Access: One of the more affordable options for experiencing 5G on a OnePlus device, offering high-speed connectivity without a high price tag. 2. High-Refresh-Rate Display: Its 6.72-inch LCD display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling, gaming, and general use feel smoother compared to standard 60Hz screens. 3. Good Battery Life: Comes with a 5,000mAh battery that can last a full day with typical use, along with 67W fast charging, which can get the phone to around 80% in just about 30 minutes. 4. Solid Primary Camera: The 108MP primary sensor performs well in good lighting, capturing clear and detailed images, which is impressive for this price range. 5. OnePlus Software: OxygenOS, OnePlus's custom skin, is known for being clean, smooth, and less cluttered compared to some other Android skins. Cons: 1. LCD Screen Instead of OLED: Unlike some competitors, it has an LCD instead of an OLED display, so colors arent as vibrant, and blacks are not as deep. 2. Limited Processor: The Snapdragon 695 chip is decent but not very powerful. It may feel a bit sluggish with more intensive tasks or high-end gaming. 3. Average Low-Light Photography: The cameras low-light performance isnt great, which may lead to noisy or blurry photos in dim settings."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Subramanian,Awesome Phone,5,"I had been using Samsung phone for years together in the past. Though it is also a good brand, recently I changed it to Oneplus nord CE 3 for the first time. It is really an awesome phone in terms of looks, performance and fast charging. Value for money."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Prachi Hatkar,One plus forever,5,"After using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G for a while, Im quite impressed with what it offers at its price point. The 6.72-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes the screen incredibly smooth, especially while scrolling and playing games. The colors are vivid, and watching videos or browsing feels quite immersive. The performance is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset, which has been decent for everyday tasks like browsing, using social media, and light gaming. Multitasking is seamless thanks to the 8GB RAM, and the phone handles most apps without lag. However, for more intense gaming or heavy usage, it can show some limitations compared to higher-end models. One of the highlights for me is the 108MP main camera. It captures photos with impressive detail, especially in well-lit conditions. The colors are sharp, and its great for casual photography. Low-light performance, though, could be better, as the images sometimes appear grainy. The 16MP front camera works well for selfies, delivering clear and bright images. Battery life is another strong point. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts me a full day with moderate use, and the 67W SUPERVOOC fast charging is incredibly quickI can get from 0 to 80% in around 30 minutes, which is a lifesaver when Im in a hurry. In terms of design, the phone feels sturdy but lightweight, and the matte finish on the back is sleek without being too slippery. The only downside for me is that the phone lacks certain flagship features like water resistance or wireless charging, but at this price, its understandable. Overall, Id say the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers solid performance, a vibrant display, and excellent battery life for everyday users. Its a great value for the price if you're looking for a mid-range 5G phone with reliable features."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,rameshwar babu,Budget phone Antaru ra Babu....,5,"OnePlus Nord CE3 Lite 5g..... I am Going to Shortly Tell Five things About This phone.. 1) Processor This processor is snapdragon it is a allounder processor 2) Camera This camera is ultra with 108 mp and the con is ultra wide camera has not given 3) Battery The charger is awesome with 80w and nearly it is taking 20 mins to charge 50 percent 4) Display The display is ok but they should cover amoled display in this price 5) Combination In this price range we are getting poco x5 pro 5g but poco phone will break off when it fall down and while we search for snapdragon processor and 108mp camera the OnePlus Nord CE3 Lite 5g phone is super Additional:- The phone volume is super The phone is made up of plastic but it seems like glass design So, I suggest OnePlus Nord CE3 Lite 5g for those who believe in snapdragon and who want 108 mp camera and the other thing is we can expand Ram by unused rom and the appearance is awesome"
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Mohan B.,Buttery smooth OS on capable hardware,5,"Just got my OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite yesterday and started using it straight away. Really a breeze like feeling using the device! Got Android 14 version of Oxygen OS also installed as it was available. Overall very satisfied with the general use like WhatsApp, EMails, other utility apps like MyGate, Airtel, Vi, MyJio, YouTube, GPay, amongst others. Performance is very decent for this price point. Hats off to OnePlus team in designing such a cost effective device. One input from my side would be that DSU update option is missing in Developer Options, which would be nice to have. Request OnePlus team to consider enabling that for such a capable device. (Yet to use the Camera, but i am confident it will be decent for sure.)"
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,ganta vijaya suguna,Nice mobile,5,After I used 2 months then i wrote review...Screen touch ..to smooth and too fast also.. it's nice..
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Amit Kumar,Super Phone (Buttery Smooth),5,"I'm absolutely blown away by its performance! This phone has exceeded all my expectations and more. The 5G connectivity ensures lightning-fast speeds, making browsing and streaming a seamless experience. The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and sharp detail, perfect for watching videos and playing games. The camera quality is top-notch, capturing clear and crisp photos even in low-light conditions. Plus, the battery life is impressive, easily lasting me a full day on a single charge. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. If you're looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone with premium features, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G is the way to go!"

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Placeholder,Value for money,5,"1. Phone looks good. I would give a 4 star for appearance. I personally did not like cameras popping up at the back. 2. The 5G connectivity is great. We have a black spot nearby our office where everyone gets poor mobile signal and can hardly make online payment. But with this phone and it's connectivity, I am making the payments in no time. I get 4 signal bars there with 5G while others are struggling to get 4G signal. 3. I felt the mobile price is Rs.1500 to Rs.2000 higher than it's worth. 4. Camera quality is super good. Room for improvement in motion capture though. 5. I am sure everyone will be happy with the battery this phone has. With 5000mah battery, I can use the phone for a complete day in one charge(you can use it for 2 days too if you don't use it much). Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Shervin M,Slightly overpriced.,5,"1. Awesome Battery life and super fast charging (67w) 80w charger is provided. 2. Adfree and bloatware free OS no other phones under 20k have this. OxygenOS is just a name but , its a bloatware free clean fluid ColorOS experience. (Hot apps junk was there but its gone after 1st update.) 3. Speakers and loud and have ample bass great one for music listeners. 4. Display is good color calibration is done well but, its an LCD panel and refresh rate is mostly in 60 and 90hz .120Hz applies in first party apps and appdrawer mostly. 5. Cameras are good in well lit conditions In the dark its struggle a bit like every other phones in this segment. Videos are average no OIS support and stuck at 1080p. 6. Processor is SD 695 5G its good for normal and light users not for heavy gamers. They should have gone for a dimensity 920/930 for this for making it a better package at this price. 7. Call quality and cellular reception is great. And it has enough 5G band (9 bands) And have good WiFi reception too. 8. RAM Management is good. Didn't noticed lag or jitter in my usage. 9. Fingerprint is side mounted one. Quick and reliable. Overall its a good for light - medium users with decent performance and ad free bloatware free experience. Ideal price for this phone in my opinion is 17.5k. For 20k its bit premium OnePlus charging for the logo behind it."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Karthik Krishnamoorthy,Good Phone,5,"Good Phone. I think it is pretty phone. I am thinking of buying this series from next time onwards instead of buying flagship as I am not heavy user since I do not play games. I only check emails, spend just few mins on social media, OTT. Only problem is Camera. I have not checked camera of this phone. I bought this phone for my parents. Apart from camera, updates provided by OnePlus for this is only two. These are the only pain points. Else these are good Phone. If they increase at least number of updates, I will buy it instead of other companies' flagship."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Rahul Jain,OnePlus Nord CE 5G Lite Review: Affordable Power and Performance in Style,5,"The OnePlus Nord CE 5G Lite is a sleek and powerful smartphone that offers a premium user experience at an affordable price point. With its Chromatic Gray finish, the phone looks elegant and sophisticated, and it feels great to hold in the hand. One of the key selling points of the OnePlus Nord CE 5G Lite is its 5G capability, which allows for lightning-fast internet speeds and seamless streaming of high-quality video content. The phone also comes equipped with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, providing ample space for all your apps, photos, and videos. The phone's 6.43-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display is another standout feature, offering vibrant colors and crisp, clear visuals. The phone also has a 90Hz refresh rate, which makes scrolling through menus and apps feel incredibly smooth and responsive. The camera system on the OnePlus Nord CE 5G Lite is also impressive, with a 108-megapixel primary camera, an 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 2-megapixel monochrome camera. The camera produces sharp, detailed photos with accurate colors, and the ultra-wide lens is great for capturing expansive landscapes and group photos. Overall, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G Lite is a fantastic smartphone that offers excellent value for money. It has a sleek and stylish design, powerful performance, and an impressive camera system, making it a great choice for anyone in the market for a new phone."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Amazon Customer,Great phone for this price,5,"1 plus is amazing ....Speed, appearance, image quality, camera, sound is great. Fast charge . Anytime better than a Samsung phone for this range. I'm in love with quality of pic taken out from this phone . I feel I got the best phone till date with a best price . Earlier used Samsung M51 and paid 24k in 2020 but not great . Samsung only has a name coz of the brand but the phone was never great .infact it's not listed on online platform if need to exchange it either. Thank you One plus for coming up with a mid range phone with good features for middle class who don't like spending a bomb buying expensive phones. I'm glad to have opted buying this phone ."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Asavari G,One of the best buys in the range.,5,"Have been a loyal one plus user for last 7 yrs so much so that despite an iPhone hv kept on using ome plus additionally. So when I wanted to relplace the 7 yr old one plus five, I gave Nord Lite a try and belive me its a great decision. Full marks for all the features incl camera. Initially hesitant to buy a lime green color but it looks nice and definitely different than the typical black ones. Always grab one plus product during Amazon sale times as there's a huge price reduction. In alll a happy purchase I must say!!"

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Dinesh MJ,Need good battery & bloat free software. Get this phone,4,If you need a good phone with good battery life and bloat free software at this price. Then get this blindly. Phone is built rock solid. Having finger print reader on the side is actually a gift then having on screen painful finger print reader. Side finger print unlocks faster than on screen ones Buy a spigen case worth rs 500. It is making the phone look like premium ones. Increase virtual ram to 16gb on about settings Get 256 gb internal storage for future good. Whats poor: Very average camera Screen feels laggy at times It's 70hz display in reality not 120hz

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Placeholder,Product review after 1 month of purchase,4,"Well, I'm writing my review on this product after buying 1 month ago. Previously I had Oppo K10 so if I'm comparing my experience with OnePlus Nord CE 3 lite, it should charge more fastly within 30 min because it has 67 woocsuper charger but it still taking time upto 1 hour where my previous Oppo K10 also takes approx 60 to 75 min with only 33 superwooc charger so in comparison OnePlus should faster. When comes to camera quality I don't find much difference between OppoK10 and OnePlus where back camera for Oppo was of 50 pixel and OnePlus has 108 pixel but quality seems equal. Well in all other aspect OnePlus Nord CE 3 lite in the prize range of 18000 is worth it and because of that I'm still like to give 4 rating for this product."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,abhishek singh,Nice product,4,It's been two years of using it . I love it
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,vipul,Kindly think twice before to buy OnePlus,4,"Overall phone is ok but one thing , battery life is not supposed to be perfect, it charge fast because of the charger simultaneously the battery drain so quickly, compare to my previous Android phones. I don't see any extra facility in this phone. My previous redmi note 8 Pro mobile was bit better compared to this oneplus nord C3 light. Camera is okay, game simple game like a cricket game sometime it stuck so I don't recommend anybody to buy this mobile for playing games on this mobile."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Anup kumar jain,Affordable phone but touch is little hard,4,"I bought this phone for my father, who wanted under budget phone. It is a good phone with long battery. Just that touch is not very swift and can contains only limited apps. It does says as per its specifics, but camera quality could be improved better. The camera flash is not so good."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,am.pere,Keeps up to the oneplus standard.,4,"I have been using this phone for a week now and I am very impressed with its performance and features. The phone is sleek and lightweight, with a beautiful chromatic gray color that changes hue depending on the light. The display is bright and crisp, with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and gaming a pleasure. The camera is also amazing, with a 64MP main sensor that captures stunning details and colors. The night mode is especially impressive, as it can take clear and bright photos even in low-light conditions. The battery life is also great, as it can last for a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports fast charging with the included 30W charger, which can charge the phone from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. The phone also has 5G connectivity, which makes browsing and streaming faster and smoother. The phone runs on OxygenOS 12, which is based on Android 12. The software is clean and user-friendly, with no bloatware or ads. It also has some useful features like dark mode, always-on display, Zen mode, and more. The phone also has a headphone jack, which is rare these days. The sound quality is decent, both from the speakers and the earphones. The phone also has a fingerprint scanner on the power button, which is fast and reliable. The phone also has face unlock, which works well in most situations. Overall, I am very happy with this phone and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly 5G smartphone with great performance and features. It is definitely worth the price and it offers a lot of value for money. It is one of the best phones I have ever used and I don't regret buying it at all."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Gautam Chatterjee,Nice,4,"No doubt the phone is a good one. Fast and easy to use. But I need to comment regarding the exchange system of Amazon and their promise to give a demo. Firstly, the delivery man said he didn't have any knowledge about what was to be done. After watching the condition of my old phone, he promptly told me that he was taking the phone. I had to uninstall the apps in a hurry. The battery however is not that strong. The screen guard is yet to arrive, which should have been sent along with the phone."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,PRABHU,Decent Device under the price segment,4,"Pros and Cons as per one month of usage: - Pro's 1. Packed with completed assessories including 80W charger, Transparent back Case and pre-applied screen protector. Won't cost extra on pocket. 2. Smooth software experience with 120 Hz high refresh rate. 3. 8 GB &amp; above RAM and has excellent ram management. 4. True 5G with 10-11 5G bands, as minimum 8 5G bands are necessary for better and stable 5G network coverage. 5. As expected, disappointment on camera has been fixed with 2nd software updates in the 1st week of May 2023. Cons 1. Slightly less bright display may irritate in sunlight. 2. The worst Google dailer that won't allow silent call recording, to directly place a videos call without sharing personal data on Google meet app i.e. without signing in to another Google spyware especially when two SIMs are installed. 3. The tall &amp; 200 gms, a bulky smartphone would require both the hand for operation for most of the people. 4. One plus has not clarified anything about future updates. But users can expect 2 Android updates and 3 years of security update. 5. Existing 2-3 uninstallable bloatwares could have been avoided to make the Oxygen OS = (Colour OS - bloatwares). 6. Some youtubers may say it doesn't support 4K videos. It is upto you, how many times you watch 4K videos online that requires 5-7 times of data? If you are comfortable with 5-7 times extra data recharge, definitely you should look at 4K supporting devices. 7. Does not justify it's 20k price. Brand has cleverly started with the minimum 8GB varient to earn from this unwanted &amp; forcefull specs."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,A k,Overpriced and Underperforming,3,"Ive been using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite, and honestly, Im not satisfied with it, especially considering the price. It feels like youre paying an extra 2000 just for the OnePlus brand, when you could get a similar phone from Realme for much less. The camera is quite disappointing, especially for indoor shots, and the video quality in low light is very poor. The processor is underwhelmingit often feels laggy, especially during multitasking, which is frustrating for a phone in this price range. After just six months, its started taking 3-4 seconds to unlock when I press the power button, which is concerning. To make matters worse, the battery has degraded quickly. Initially, it would last two days, but now Im struggling to get through even a single day. Overall, I wouldnt recommend this phoneit just doesnt offer the performance or quality youd expect for the price."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Priyanka Bedi,Phone = Great. Delivery Exp. w Exchange = Third Class.,3,"I have purchased two One Plus Nord CE Lite 5G phones, one for my Mother (60) and one for my sister (18). Both of them are able to use the phone without any difficulties and have positive feedback regarding the features, respectively. While the phone was received in the best condition with all the contents of the box, the delivery experience of the second time purchase was harsh. The Amazon Delivery Agent tried to loot us by demanding cash against the exchange phone stating he is not convinced that the phone's (6+ years old) brightness is at par with the brightness of his phone (1 year old). We (my uncle and I) politely tried to explain him that an old phone will have lesser brightness as compared to a new phone due to the upgrade in technology, however, he was adamant to get cash against it. We humbly stood our ground and refused to agree with him. He took the phone, gave us the new phone, the product without performing the 'Open Box Delivery' and without taking the 'Delivery OTP' and angrily stormed off. I have registered a complain by opting to leave 'Delivery Feedback' to the Amazon Team, however, I felt I should share my experience to help everyone be aware and safe. The Delivery Agent acted rude and made me feel quite insecure and unsafe. Thankfully my uncle was home and he could intervene between the conversation to help me out in dealing with him as cordially as we could. So, if you are opting for the 'Exchange' option, I recommend, you sell the phone locally and use the cash/money received against it to add up to your budget for purchasing the phone instead of relying on Amazon for it. As for the phone, you can rely on OnePlus to give you the best features without burning a hole in your pocket."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Placeholder,xtremely Disappointing Phone with Subpar Camera and Operating System,2,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of using a certain smartphone, and I must say it was an incredibly disappointing device. From the camera quality to the operating system, this phone fell short in every aspect, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied. Allow me to elaborate on my experience. Let's start with the camera. It's hard to believe that in this day and age, a smartphone can have such a poor camera. The images captured with this phone were consistently grainy, lacked sharpness, and struggled with color accuracy. Even in well-lit environments, the camera failed to produce decent results. Whether it was capturing a scenic landscape or taking a simple selfie, the final output was always disappointing. If you enjoy taking high-quality photos or value a good camera on your phone, this is definitely not the device for you. Moving on to the operating system, it was equally underwhelming. The phone ran on an outdated version of the operating system, lacking many of the features and optimizations found in modern smartphones. The user interface felt clunky, and navigating through the menus was a frustrating experience. I frequently encountered lag and slow response times, making even simple tasks feel like a chore. The app ecosystem was also limited, with several popular applications either unavailable or incompatible with the device. It was a constant reminder of the phone's outdated software and lack of support from the manufacturer. Battery life was another major letdown. Despite claims of decent battery performance, this phone struggled to last through a full day of moderate usage. I found myself constantly searching for a charging outlet or carrying a power bank wherever I went. It's frustrating to have a phone that can't keep up with your daily needs and constantly requires recharging. Furthermore, the build quality of the phone left much to be desired. The materials used felt cheap and plasticky, lacking the premium feel you would expect from a modern smartphone. The overall design was uninspiring, and the device felt bulky and uncomfortable to hold for extended periods. In terms of value for money, this phone falls far short. Considering its price point, there are numerous alternatives on the market that offer superior camera quality, smoother performance, and more up-to-date software. It's difficult to justify spending hard-earned money on a phone that fails to deliver on the basic expectations of a smartphone in this day and age. In conclusion, I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this particular phone. Its poor camera quality, outdated operating system, disappointing battery life, and lackluster build quality make it an incredibly frustrating device to use. Save yourself the headache and explore other options that offer better features and overall user experience."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Neha yadav,Bad experience,2,"I am writing this review after using this phone for 1 year. I personally don't like 1+ Nord CE 3 Lite 5G phone. My previous phone (i.e., Realme 1) was far better than this one. There is no in built music player and if u download one then there are so many ads, which are very annoying. Sometimes, audio stop coming in all apps including music, mx player, VLC, youtube, etc. I have to restart the phone then only will come. Sometimes it hangs within 3-4 months. But battery charging is fast. And life is also fine."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Srivenkat,Android Security Update stopped after Nov 2023,2,Bought this phone for a friend a few months back. OnePlus is not keeping their word about providing security updates for 3 years. They have stopped security updates since Nov 2023 i.e. within 8 Months. How will they provide Android 14 or 15??? Worst part is they are still selling this phone when they are not able to roll out security updates for the past 4-5 month. Very ordinary camera for a 20K phone.

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Primer d.,average for the price range,2,cons - camera is a total waste ..not upto the mark ..not even competes with the other mobiles with less price range..very unstable camera and also no 4k video support. processor- okay for a mid range user..but lags for a high end user pros- only good thing about the mobile is battery -5000mah and fast charge. and 5G . summaary: not worth the hype for the price range and lot of glitches to be fixed.
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Anirban Jyoti Gupta,Often gets hanged !,2,After only six months the mobile started hanging and stopping! It takes long time to open. It's now just 9 months old but not working properly. When try to open Photos it regularly gets dark . After long wait it may some time open or not. Totally disappointed with this product. Thinking of changing it immediately. The customer care support of one plus is also very poor in Silchar. In my opinion one shouldn't go for an ONEPLUS mobile set.

Its says 108MP and try to capture a pic with 6X Zoom and its worst clarity you ever see. Even without Zoom also cam features and clarity is too bad. Some times In prime areas it will not catch the network properly. It heats up very fast and even with 5G sim, it drops network at prime locations.

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Anonymous,Camera could be a huge disappointment for One Plus loyalists,2,"I have owned 2 One Plus phones previously and have absolutely enjoyed the experience. One of my One plus phones lasted 6 years, which is most commendable. I have loved the design of the phone , the user interface and most importantly for its camera quality. The last category is what the new One plus 3 lite performs poorly. If you take pride over taking decently shot photos, on your mobile phone, this is not a phone for you. Hopefully, I will be able to return this latest purchase and buy another One Plus model."
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Pankaj Bhati,Bad USP (Camera),2,"I was using oneplus 9R which has 48+16+5 MP camera and bought CE3 considering the 108MP camera as the USP defined by the Company. However after using it for few days, realised that the Camera is not even close to 9R (48 MP). The key (Camera) defined by the company is grossly incorrect and leading to false representation. I was expecting good camera quality with 108 MP, but it really disappointing and i getting a feel of buying some Chinese phone. Be-aware if you are buying this phone for camera quality. Rating 2 for camera quality and false representation."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Mateeullah Ansari,Heating Issue and Battery Not Lasting More Than 3 Hours,1,"I bought this mobile (OnePlus Nord CE 3 Light 5 G) day before yesterday (12th Oct 2023). The phone which I received gets heated easily and battery is not lasting more than 3 hours. I raised this issue with Amazon and they asked me to avail replacement from Service Center, I visited Service Center but they refused to support. Again I connected with Amazon on this issue, they arranged a technician visit tomorrow (15th Oct 2023) and based on technician's investigation report, no one contacted during the scheduled timeframe, again called Amazon support team, they promised for the refund if I didn't get any response within 8 hours. But within 8 hours, I received an IVR call to get the confirmation on the denial of technician visit. I didn't give the consent for cancellation of visit. Despite of this, technician visit was rescheduled to next day. Next day, no one visited home, but someone called and asked us to download an application and he performed all the activities and submitted the report that the phone is fine, but on call he said that phone has battery issues and he will submit the report accordingly. But he didn't do this. I again called Amazon support to know the further process of refund next day but surprisingly they denied for the refund and asked me to get in touch with service center. I asked them why you wasted 3 days of my warranty period which they had no answer. But overall result is I have to suffer with the defective mobile as no one is taking ownership of this issue. I would strongly recommend to everyone not to purchase any electronic device from Amazon."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Manpreet Sharma,CHEAP QUALITY PRODUCT | DON'T BUY,1,I have been using One Plus Nord CE3 Lite for the last 8 months and despite having screen glass and back cover phone dropped from 1 feet height and the phone is dead now. Customer centre is saying motherboard is dead and it will take 8-10k to repair this phone now. The quality of this phone is extremely cheap and of low quality that such weak impact was not tolerated by this phone. Its a huge loss for me as i have just used it for 8 months and paid 19k and its dead now. Please think twice before buying this. Would recommend you to probably avoid buying this phone.

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,mmr,Defective product,1,"The phone started giving trouble from the second month of purchasing. It started getting weak communication. While talking, signal breaks, voices become inaudible, frequent call breaks experienced. Took the phone to the local service centre. After a marathon wait of couple of hours, the phone was seen by the attending technician without lodging the complaint as by that time, office hours was over. He updated the software which was in queue and told me that it should be ok now. But there is hardly any improvement and same is the condition as earlier. Now, I have to go once again to the service centre after travelling 15x2 km paying hefty cab fare. It may be noted that the service centre was run by a single widow counter wherein my turn was at 46th. I wrote a complaint through the email ids (L1&amp; L2 level) displayed at the service centre but till date, no one bothers to reply back. With the above, I demand a new phone from the dealer through Amazon."

OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Amazon Customer,"OnePlus' claims are bogus, this is an absolutely garbage phone.",1,"This is a garbage phone, none of the manufacturing guarantees are honoured and the servicing is laughably poor. OnePlus claims that their warranty only covers 'manufacturing defects' but does not define what they are as a means to mislead potential customers into believing that this a quality device on par with other phones in the market. I purchased one of these phones in October, by March it was riddled with issues. What's worse, when I took it to the service center, they asked me to sign a waiver essentially saying that through the course of repair, the phone's condition may actually worsen to 'Dead' or 'Unusable' and OnePlus does not guarantee against it. Furthermore, this repair was fully payable as the warranty only covered these vague, undefined 'manufacturing defects' and worse, by bringing it into the OnePlus service center for fixing, I would void my guarantee - absolutely laughable. DO NOT BUY!"
OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite,Kanika rajput,Worst battery backup,1,"Here I'm giving review in 4th month usage. The battery backup is very poor once it comes down to 50% it immediately drains,not we call it drains it gets switch off. And until I didn't put it on charge it didn't starts . Means in short if you feel like you can spend your day with this half a battery then you're making a blunder by depending on it. From the day I bought I am using it on battery saving mode till today it's battery is worst and they didn't even consider it for return . Went to sevoce station as well withing one week of its purchase they also didn't entertain so left the option of using it. Seriously I haven't thought of a brand name of one plus would be this much bad in battery's."

CHARGING : Charging is worse . I never feel it as 67w charger. Sometimes my redmi 33w charges faster than OnePlus 67w. CAMERA: 100 Mp is just a number. I never expected this camera quality from OnePlus. My redmi 2 years old 64 mp camera is much better than this mobile. DISPLAY : Onther brand provide superamoled even at 5k less than this mobile but this mobile don't have. BATTERY: Battery drains faster reason is no superamoled display. Conclusion: I strongly feel a technology lover should never buy this white elephant.

Camera - a 10k phone would have better camera than this 2. Performance - Good performance for regular work, but for gaming, it'll lag 3. Screen - LCD and not AMOLED 3. Interface - probably the only area where fully satisfied 4. Battery : Good, fast charging also helps. Camera alone will disappoint you like crazy and screen and performance too sometimes.

Being a music lover and a gamer, I was impressed by these Truly Wireless Earbuds. Design and Comfort However, the Midnight color option went for a sleek design complemented by a premium rubber grip case that helped it fit well. The earbuds are light in weight helping them in long duration usages. Sound Quality The 13mm bass drivers produce solid bass frequencies alongside clear sound.

The Midnight color variant is chic, and feather-like weight of the ear tips permits prolonged use without fatigue, as pertains to the design and build. To be precise, the sound system makes use of 13mm bass drivers that can produce heavy thumping bass as well as deliver clear and enjoyable audio without any distortion. When it comes to battery life, I must say I am also impressed with it as it gives over 90 hours playback on a single worthy charge.

Here is my extensive review: Design and Comfort (4.5/5) The Z40 Pro has elegant and curved shapes, enhanced by a premium rubber grip case that sits well in the ear. The Midnight color variant is classy and the earbuds are lightweight, thus friendly to prolonged wearing hours. Sound Quality (4.7/5) The 13mm bass drivers produces punchy and deep bass alongside clear and well-balanced audio. The soundstage produced is also quite commendable with fair separation and clarity levels. Whether V2652T is used for music, listening to podcasts or even playing games, it indeed offers an immersed experience. Gaming Performance (4.8/5) In gaming, I think Z40 Pro has an edge over its competitors with its 45ms low latency. There was perfect synchronization between audio and visual which was a plus during gaming. Battery Life (5/5) The advertised battery life of 100H is something else, and I was able to get more than 90H of use on a single charge. Additional Features (4.5/5) - The quad-microphone ENC system reduces background noise and improves voice quality. - Bluetooth 5.3 enables seamless pairings. - IPX5 rating water resistant. - Flexible silicon ear tips for tight fit. If exquisite and well designed TWS earbud that is India-made is what you enjoy, Boult Audio Z40 Pro is a good answer."

Boult Z40 Pro,Sahil Tagoria,Calling Quality Bad,3,The quality of Calling is very bad. Otherwise sound is awesome. Second cant hear our voice properly. This is the problem.
Boult Z40 Pro,Lalit Mohan Joshi,Fine product,3,"I bought it 1 mounth ago. I got it for 1399. Let's talk about pros: 1.Good ear fit my ears area little smaller so the no earbuds completely if its in my ear but boult products has a good fit(5/5) 2. Good case quality like it has a mat finish which protects it from 80% of scratches (5/5). 3. The thing is it has a USB C type charging which makes it easy to carry in long trips as you dont need to carry extra cables. 4. Good sound quality base is also balanced in balanced sound level(4/5) Now for the cons: 1. Bad build quality of earbuds like I accidentally dropped right bud from my ear while I was in my room and it opened though it popped back when I popped it(2.5/5). 2. We have to take it out of the case to bring it to pairing mode just opening the case doesn't do the job which is kind of good in some cases(3/5). 3. At high volumes the sound is pretty bad too base dies at high volume and it sounds distorted.(2/5). 4. While connectivity is also an issue sometimes it suffers to transfer noise even above 5 mtrs(3/5) All in all the earbuds are good value at 1399 but check for sales because it was at its lowest 999 on flipkart just before holi 2024 Its suitable for the daily tasks like listening to music, casual gaming ( not suitable for gamers), regular meetings also the design of the earbuds are also good. The earbuds are not for gamers like gaming mode works but not upto the mark. If you wish to hear some high quality sounds its not for you. Also not for field workers."
Boult Z40 Pro,Raj,Battery backup,3,I rate this product 3.5/5 Battery backup is not that much good (2/5) Build quality is ok (3/5) Noice cancellation is not working properly (3/5)
Boult Z40 Pro,Balaji,Good,3,Awesome product and good sound quality is worth for money.... but calling performance not satisfy .. noise cancellation not worth
Boult Z40 Pro,Battery is not good,Battery performance is not good,2,Design and enc are best . But in batterywise it is a total disaster . I didn't recommend this. Go for other brands
Boult Z40 Pro,Awesomeness,It's a 2.5 star from me,2,"Idk what to say, right after warranty period one earbud stop working"

Boult Z40 Pro,Efficient and Reliable - The Bajaj Dx-6 Delivers!,Mixed Feelings About the BoAt Z40 Pro Earbuds,2,"After using the BoAt Z40 Pro Earbuds, Ive had a less than satisfactory experience. The sound quality leaves much to be desired, with the bass being overrated and overshadowing the original sound profile. Ive encountered a sound leakage issue when the volume exceeds 70%, which is quite inconvenient. However, below this volume threshold, the earbuds seem to perform without any leakage. Upon purchase, I immediately noticed a touching problem with the right side bud, which was disappointing. Another downside is the lack of caller ID announcement features, meaning I cant hear who is calling when I have the earbuds on. This is a significant drawback for me. Additionally, the earbuds claim to support dual pairing, but Ive found that they can only connect to a single device at a time, which is not what I expected based on the products description. In conclusion, the BoAt Z40 Pro Earbuds have not lived up to my expectations. The issues with sound quality, functionality, and connectivity are too significant to overlook."
Boult Z40 Pro,Chandrika,Not durable,2,"Ear bud is not working after use of three months ,worst product"
Boult Z40 Pro,samyakpriyam,Not worth it.,2,"The media could not be loaded. Cons- 1- if you wear this inside helmet and try to take a call , you won't be able to because your voice won't be heard by person on other side of call. 2- if am using it in office and attend the call ans start talking slowly then also the person on other side of call can't hear me. I need to speak much louder so that other person can hear me. It's like shouting in office. 3- fit is not at all good. It comes out of ear very easily after 2-3 minutes. It doesn't fulfill my main purpose so I have given 2 star. PROS- 1- connectivity is quick. 2- no voice lag while playing games in mobile /ipad 3- Battery backup is really nice 4- look is also nice 5- sound quality is better than similar counterparts"
Boult Z40 Pro,Mayur Gangasagre,"Sound quality, Battery back up not good enough",2,"Bass is low, Voice clarity is ok, battery back up promise is 100 hr but in reality its around 60-70 hrs, earbuds run for 6 to 7 hrs in full charge. While using this ear buds you can go back to era of 2000, where if you are or anyone around you getting a phone call you will hear some noise in your ear buds, fit n comfortwise its not that good but not that bad either. Lots of improvements needed. Not much difference in music mode, game mode n normal mode feature all are almost same."

Boult Z40 Pro,Rohith Edalath,Not good- just not good.,2,"Disclaimer - i know what I'm talking about cause I work with sound. The sound quality of these buds can't be priced over 600bucks. It looks good, maybe material is good too but the sound - which should be the focus of earbuds, is just horrible. Long battery life, clear calling all is good but if the sound quality is not upto mark, that crushes the earbuds. There is too much bass, no clarity in the mids and highs. If you increase the volume, you get bass and noise as I'd like to say. There's no definition to the sound you are hearing. Sorry for being too honest. Maybe its a problem with earbuds, I'm used to using wired headphones and they are just miles better than this."
Boult Z40 Pro,Luke Rodrigues,Mic,2,The mic is worse. Nobody can hear you talk. Even though i replaced once. Listen quality is good. Also it's not comfortable to ears. Looks are simple. Even if you touch the earbuds it gets off. Overall unsatisfied.

Boult Z40 Pro,Pradeep,Boult Audio product review and Customer support services,1,"I am dissatisfied with the customer service provided by Boult Audio.I lodged a complaint for my Boult Earbuds.I experienced both a battery problem and a ghost touch issue with my Earbuds.I later sent earbuds to your office via courier using Delhivery services.I got a product from Boult Audi, but it was a pair of repaired earbuds with the same problem I had before. My left earbud is experiencing a Ghost-Touch issue and is not functioning correctly. Touch control functions automatically to pause and play when listening to any song or video. boult website lists a service center in Indore, but when I visited, they told me that Boult Audio's services had already been discontinued I bought earbuds for 1100 rupees once and sent them to the Boult office for a fee of 200 rupees. If I send them again, I will have to pay another 200 rupees. Additionally, this requires a minimum of 2 weeks. cost of purchase - 1100 rupees The cost for sending the product to your service center as a one-time delivery is 200 rupees. Once more, I encounter an issue where I would have to pay 200 Rupees if I send it again. I don't believe it's worth it to pay again."
Boult Z40 Pro,Anonymous,Non durable buds,1,"The buds seemed fine initially. But after a week or so, the buds started causing an issue - they were not getting disconnected from my macbook even after putting them back in case. This caused battery getting drained overnight. I reset the buds and tried lot of things but nothing worked. Finally sent them to Boult team to claim warranty (btw you need to pay shipping charges yourself), they repaired and sent buds back. But after sometime, same issue reoccured. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. Go for a more reliable brand like OnePlus whose buds will cost you 800-900 more but they are totally worth it."
Boult Z40 Pro,Akshay Rajagopal,"Worst Product ,Waste of money",1,"Don't ever buy this product . Charging issue started after 1 month of usage . It won't even last 1 hour ,either of the ear bud will be drained out faster .Mic won't work if a call comes into between watching videos .Pairing issues occurs in between . Even after complaining for the same ,The first thing they asked was to give 5 star rating so that the complaint and warranty issues could only be processed .After that no reply from their side .Moving legally for this issue since every rupees is valuable"
Boult Z40 Pro,Sajid Saifi,Extremely Disappointing Quality,1,"I recently purchased ear Buds and unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing. The product quality is extremely poor, and it fails to meet even the most basic expectations. First and foremost, the build quality is abysmal. The materials feel cheap and flimsy, which is surprising given the price point. Within just a few days of use, the War Buds started showing signs of wear and tear, and the left earbud stopped working altogether. Additionally, the sound quality is subpar. There's a noticeable lack of clarity, and the bass is almost non-existent. It's hard to enjoy any music or audio content with these, as the audio sounds tinny and distorted. I expected much better performance for a product marketed as premium. Another major issue is the battery life. Despite the advertised hours of usage, I found myself needing to recharge the War Buds far more frequently than promised. This is highly inconvenient and makes them impractical for daily use. Lastly, the customer service experience was frustrating. When I reached out for assistance with the malfunctioning earbud, the response was slow and unhelpful. It seems there is little regard for customer satisfaction. Overall, I regret my purchase and cannot recommend Ear Buds to anyone. Save your money and invest in a more reliable and well-reviewed product. **Rating: 1/5**"
Boult Z40 Pro,Not worth it,Battery low in just 2 hours,1,Second time getting a defective product and now I can't replace. Battery is very bad. So is their return policy. P.S: You should spend on return courier to their Delhi address at your risk.

Boult Z40 Pro,Shekar Keshava Rao,Worthless build quality and shoddy after sales service,1,"1. Product quality is utter shambles. The right bud housing just fell off while on an evening walk, couldn't be found again in the darkness. The part is effectively not usable anymore, making it an expensive piece of collectible garbage. 2. After-sales service is pathetic. The centers and contacts given on the site don't work. WA chat is a nonsensical maze, and conveniently doesn't have a returns option. The list of centers and contacts given on WA are either non-existent, or not reachable; only 1 of 4 took my call. I visited one center near my home, only to be told to call a number, and that this wouldn't be covered under their services. The called number is another options maze, with no human on the other end, but just some random useless options to get a SMS with instructions. This is just weaseling out of any responsibility to the customer. Overall, a horrible experience. I will not recommend anyone buy this company's products, ever. Update 28Dec : Shipped this to Gurgaon, only to have the incompetent service say this is not covered under warranty. They shipped it back in a different box, and cheated by keeping the rubber ear covers, original warranty and manual cards that I had sent. Tried following up with contact center, which is an absolute waste of time. Now, even the right side pod is not charging, and is worthless. Overall, an utter piece of garbage. Do not buy this trash even if they give a 75% discount."

Prestige PIC 20,Biswajit pal,Comprehensive Review of the Prestige PIC 20 1600 Watts Induction Cooktop,5,"The Prestige PIC 20 1600 Watts Induction Cooktop promises a blend of efficiency, convenience, and safety with features tailored for the modern Indian kitchen. This review delves into its key attributes, performance, and overall value to help you decide if its the right addition to your cooking arsenal. **Design and Build Quality** The Prestige PIC 20 sports a sleek black finish that complements contemporary kitchen aesthetics. Its compact and lightweight design makes it easy to store and move around. The build quality is robust, featuring a high-quality plastic body that feels durable and long-lasting. The control panel is user-friendly, with touch buttons that are responsive and intuitive to use. **Performance and Efficiency** With a power output of 1600 watts, the PIC 20 ensures rapid heating and efficient cooking. The induction technology ensures that energy is directly transferred to the cooking vessel, reducing cooking time and energy consumption. This model is particularly suitable for boiling, frying, and simmering, catering well to a variety of cooking styles. **Indian Menu Options** A standout feature is the Indian Menu Option, designed to simplify the preparation of popular Indian dishes. Pre-set cooking modes for items like dosa, curry, and chapati take the guesswork out of temperature and time settings, allowing for consistent results every time. This feature is particularly beneficial for those who enjoy traditional Indian cuisine but want the convenience of automated settings. **Automatic Power and Temperature Adjustment** The automatic power and temperature adjustment feature ensures that the cooktop operates efficiently without overheating or underheating. This smart functionality adjusts the power and temperature levels based on the dish being prepared, enhancing cooking precision and preventing food from burning. It also contributes to energy savings by optimizing power usage. **Automatic Voltage Control** Voltage fluctuations are a common issue in many regions, and the Prestige PIC 20 addresses this with its automatic voltage control feature. This function protects the appliance from damage due to sudden voltage spikes or drops, ensuring longevity and stable performance. It provides peace of mind, knowing that the cooktop is safeguarded against electrical inconsistencies. **Safety Features** Safety is a critical aspect of any kitchen appliance, and the Prestige PIC 20 excels in this regard. The cooktop includes features such as an anti-magnetic wall, which ensures that the heat is confined to the cooking vessel, reducing the risk of accidental burns. Additionally, the appliance automatically switches off if no pan is detected, and theres a child lock function to prevent unintended usage. **Ease of Cleaning** The cooktops flat surface makes it easy to clean. Spills and splatters can be wiped away quickly, and the absence of crevices prevents food particles from getting trapped. This not only keeps the appliance looking new but also maintains hygiene. **Warranty and Customer Support** Prestige offers a 1-year warranty on the PIC 20, covering manufacturing defects and providing repair or replacement if needed. The companys customer service is generally responsive and helpful, adding an extra layer of reassurance for buyers. **Pros and Cons** *Pros:* - Efficient and rapid cooking with 1600 watts of power - Pre-set Indian menu options for convenience - Automatic power and temperature adjustments for precise cooking - Voltage control for protection against fluctuations - Robust safety features, including child lock and pan detection - Easy to clean and maintain - 1-year warranty with good customer support *Cons:* - Limited to induction-compatible cookware - The touch panel might be less responsive with wet or oily fingers - No timer function for delayed cooking **Conclusion** The Prestige PIC 20 1600 Watts Induction Cooktop is a versatile and reliable appliance for any kitchen. Its powerful performance, user-friendly features, and safety mechanisms make it a standout choice, particularly for those who frequently prepare Indian dishes. While it has minor limitations, such as the need for compatible cookware and a sometimes finicky touch panel, its overall benefits far outweigh these drawbacks. For its price range, the Prestige PIC 20 offers excellent value and is a worthy investment for efficient and enjoyable cooking."

Limited Power Options: This cooktop has limited power options, which may not be ideal for those who need high heat for cooking certain dishes. However, it still offers a range of power options suitable for most cooking needs. Overall, the Prestige PIC 20.0 Induction cooktop is a great option for those who want an energy-efficient, safe, and easy-to-clean cooktop. It has a sleek design and offers efficient cooking, making it a great addition to any kitchen. While there are some cons to consider, such as the need for special cookware and limited power options, these are not significant drawbacks for most users."

Prestige PIC 20,Rajiv Mohan,Prestige PIC 20 Induction Cook Top,5,"I have been using Prestige Induction Cook Top since last few months. Please note the defficiencies I have come across in this equipment, as follows: 1. It has got total 9 Operation Keys + 1 On-Off key on its control panel. 2. The description of the function and operation of keys have been indicated / illustrated in a very crude and illiterate manner. No temperature figures are indicated on the keys or even in your own supplied instruction manual. It seems, manufacturer has been confident that its consumers / users would be hardly science educated / engineering qualified, hence would not understand the Units of Temperature (Degree C). Such as, you have mentioned 'Heat Milk' but not disclosed the difference in temperature obtained ?? This is equally applicable with all other control keys. The worst thing is that you have not disclosed these details even in your accompanied detailed instruction manual. 3. Your Instruction Manual has been printed in such a small FONT SIZE that it really becomes painful to go through it in detail. But Alas.............. , I could hardly find something useful in your instruction manual even after going through the same after undergoing a great amount of fatigue !!! 4. It seems, as if your manufacturer is not himself sure about the precision of the specifying figures, hence utilizing all these mal-practices to avoid any conflict !!!! 5. May I request Your Honor to kindly take care about all these important factors so that at least the Engineering qualified customers might not find and ambiguity / problem while using your products ! Sorry for the inconvenience and unpleasant script of the petty complaint,"

Prestige PIC 20,VINEET,Recommended!,5,I have been using this product for quite a while. I would recommend people to switch to electrically operated appliances instead of using LPG gas stove. Great product from safety point of view. I have been using two induction cooktop for more than 2 years and is working perfectly fine.Value for money. I'm used to this product and probably won't switch to LPG gas stove now.
Prestige PIC 20,Placeholder,Appearance.,5,"Prestige is a reputed &amp; trusted name since decades. All its products are of very good quality &amp; have a long life. This particular induction stove is also very good, nice in appearance &amp; easy to use with so many menu options. Cooks very quickly with just right amount of heat. Low in consuming electricity. Highly recommended for small family of 4-5 persons. Wattage is 1600. Other models are up to 2000 waats for big families."

Prestige PIC 20,Mirza Rohan Ahamed,Less price than local market.,5,"I got it for Rs 1999, Rs 400 less than local market price. The oven is working fine. Obviously 1600W oven takes more time to boil water than a 2000w oven, but it is ok for me as I need to cook food for 1 person , and also most of the time I need less than 1000W Power to cook."

Prestige PIC 20,Vanlalmuanzuala,Its a great product looking at the price range!!!!!!,4,The media could not be loaded. At first i received a damaged product later i return but it works perfectly fine now. It really safe time since as the inducting is really fast and heat really fast as well. The cons i see so far is that its support specific induction utensil only... meaning it wont work on regular utensils and it will display error even if you put on it. So better choose wisely before buying the utensils.
Prestige PIC 20,Tirthankar,Quite basic but good one,4,"The induction cooktop looks well made. Features are pretty basic but it gets the job done. You can get a similar induction cooktop for a lot less price from some other brands but I had made that very mistake and lost money... it was from P****n brand... anyway, so far, Prestige hasn't let me down. 1 star reduced because seller hasn't stamped the warranty card and Prestige can make it better looking at this price."
Prestige PIC 20,Tom George,Not heating water within just 12 days of use,4,"Got this product in Rs. 1999. Not worth it at all. Built quality is extremely cheap. It doesn't even heat water after 12 days of use. No error being shown. Water remains cold. Zero heating. No proper trouble shooting guidelines. Will have to take extra headache of contacting customer care and getting it fixed. Edit: updating my review after getting good customer service from Prestige. I contacted Prestige customer care and since it was in warranty period, the technician arrived at my home and fixed the issue quickly. Overall, the experience of getting it fixed got resolved. But the problem still remains with the model, where they start by default at 1400 watts, which should be corrected to a lower wattage. Many a times, we don't have enough power to get this much high wattage. If Prestige wants to keep a default value, maybe, 100 watts should be the default value, or 'Keep warm' (60 watts) should be the default setting, rather than 'Pressure cooker' mode (1400 watt). This setting kind of is responsible for ruining the circuits where people may not always have enough high wattage to support it, and low wattage easily damages the circuit. Prestige has provided protection against high voltage power supply, but low voltage / wattage power supply can also damage the circuits, and prestige hasn't taken care of low voltage power supply, by keeping default setting of 1400 watts at the start."

Prestige PIC 20,knreddy,Suitability is severely limited,4,"It is having good menu and off timer but the heat input control is based on automatic repeated on and off duration depending on menu (not on amount heat input). It always input full blast power with different duration and cycles for different menu to meet / compensate near possible suitability. For example if we select Keep Warm, it will be on for 1 sec for every 10 sec approximately, at full blast, due to this, in case of water, it will try to boil with bubbles near bottom of water for that 1 sec for every 10 sec. Further the area of heating is concentrated from inner dia of 100 mm to 140mm approx, hence it is not uniform. Not only that it heats the water in the contents of bowl , NOT the Bowl, which is slow in reduction of non uniform heating. However the plus side is low in heat wastage, means high in efficiency. I have returned it, as it was unable to maintain the water temperature at 60 Deg C in Keep Warm mode as specified , but it was making it to 85-90 Deg C as above ( full blast heating for 1sec etc) . If we select 70 Deg C in Deep fry mode (less than 70 Deg C is not provided) , it was heating to 85 Deg C and restarts heating if it falls below 65 Deg C approx, but with full intensity while heating. I anticipated this and purchased low power 1200w model but the principles and design at least of this model may not be suitable for given menu. Even coil type heaters or gas stove will also face non uniform heating issues , but when we use thick bottom such issues will be minimised as it heats the body of bowl thus conduction takes place which is faster. I feel due to the above limitations it may be acceptable to grevy type items. Updation on 01.02.2020. Infrared type like Wonderchef Easy Cook or Cello blazing 500 or 400 (other models are non infrared or induction type) have better control on temperature and uniform heating but at present they are costly. However they are also suitable to maintain 55 degree Celsius constantly."

Only thing is one has buy a different set of utensils if you want to use it primarily for all cooking. Induction utensils are slightly pricy than normal cooking pots and pans. Electricity consumption I don't know. I will find out when I get my bill.

Prestige PIC 20,Pbuyer,Better expectation from the brand!,4,Purchased this product when our old from Ken Star had gone bad with great expectation. However these are my observation: Positives: 1. There are additional pre-set power levels for various cooking.. Negatives: 1. Keypads are of 10 year old technology. 2. It claims energy saving and better energy transmission. However it takes longer time to get water boiled compared to my old Ken Star 3. Fan is so noisy. I feel their R&amp;D &amp; QA is insensitive to such finer aspects of product design. Overall it didn't meet my expectation from the brand.

Prestige PIC 20,Tarun Suri,Overall good product for the price with some drawbacks.,4,"For a first time induction stove user, It takes a while to figure out what settings and temperatures work well to cook which food items. The standard modes available are all set to high temperatures by default and end up buring my food, if i dont reduce it manually. Egs dosa cooking at the default temperature on 'dosa mode' will burn the outer layer of the dosa and leave the inner uncooked. So we have to manually reduce the temperature for dosa mode. It would be nice to be able to set our own default for each mode. For the rest its a good buy and definitely worth the cost."

I never faced any issue with the induction functionality in these 3 years. But after 1.5 years the outer body which is made of plastic fiber started cracking from back side due to heavy load. And now after 3 years, the fan has stopped working and I other issues started showing. I am yet to visit the local repair shop to get it repaired, once done will update further... Update - I got it repaired, costed less than Rs. 100 as one of the diode was dead. Now again it's working great."

It had good build quality. But this one is cheap looking. Not expected from Prestige. I had doubt about plug size before buying. I wanted 2100 watt induction cooktop but BIG plug size of 15amp is unacceptable for me. Plug size of this induction cooktop is small, normal size. It is not big, dangerous-looking 15amp plug. Bought it for occasional use in case of gas running out unexpectedly in the middle of cooking. Induction cooktop is good for backup in case you have only 1 gas cylinder."

Where as I have used one cheap local brand with all Indian food cooking options for 3 years without a single problem. Whereas this stove become dead after 2 months of usage. Warranty service was good. Repaired immediately at my premises itself. Thanks to Prestige, but I don't know how long it works ???? According to service person, there was shorting in the circuit board due to cockroaches. Cooling fan openings can't be sealed. However manufacturers should explore some idea of sealing conducting parts either by using some varnish like coating or by introducing insulating barriers between the adjacent current tracks. Or else introduce some sealed compartments for elecronic components, where additional cooling effect is not required. These are only my vague suggestions, but even local stoves also will be having same or similar components arrangements inside the stove. Hence, definitely there will be a provision 5o address this issue."

Prestige PIC 20,RP,"Fragile Top, costly to repair",3,"New review: New model has temperature settings of 500 and then 1000, earlier it was 500, 800, 1000, 1100, 1200, which was useful to control the heat better. The buttons are not feather touch. Quality of the wire is also less now. Earlier it was good and strong, now its more thin/easy to bend. They should have more stand height as the fan has very less space to get air. It gets dirty too soon, and chokes. We purchased Pigeon and it was worse. So we purchased Prestige again, it lasted 1.2 years, just about warranty time. Then it stops automatically and repair cost is 800 (nearly half its price) for 6 months. Waste, but no option. Old Review: Our Glass broke and the repair charges is 75-80% of the product. Other than that, compared to Pigeon that we purchased to replace the broken item, Prestige is good."

Prestige PIC 20,crustacean,Suitable for a household of one or two,3,"It is ideal for a family of two and is very muich ok for 1.4 k.It is not as sturdy as the Bajaj brand I used for last five years. Although claimed to be feather touch, the buttons are not that soft to operate. The presets are there but the most frequent requirement of mine is to boil water, either for drinking or for making tea. There is no suitable preset for this. Of course, you can use pressure cook mode which is the default one and decrease temp and set time. Time setting can be done up to one minute, which is good. The length of the power cord is slightly longer than one mtr. Wish it were longer. The packing wasn't very safe.Although the factory cover was opened (itself a turn-off, as far as choosing a dealer is concerned, the warranty card has no dealer stamp or date stamp."

Other than that does it's work well. Temperature is good, using and controls are easy and have different models for cooking various Indian items like roti, dosa, etc. Let's see how long this lasts.

Prestige PIC 20,W DSilva,Very disappointed,2,Keeps turning off on its own. Wont turn on mostly. Been using it since two weeks. Wish there was a way to fix this. I didnt exchange thinking it will be fine but this piece does not live up to the name of prestige. Edit: 13th oct 2020 I had to add one more star in appreciation for the technician and the technical support of prestige whos been so helpful in listening to my complaints and providing free service. Though we barely use it I had to get it fixed and got it serviced 4 times till date in less than a year. Just yesterday the technician came and changed the motherboard free of charge under warranty. Hopefully this will not give anymore trouble. I had an old one from prestige which I used for about 15 years on and off and never had issue with that one.
Prestige PIC 20,p c.,cooking of milk and tea,2,it is very difficult to make tea or boil milk. the temperature at the lowest setting ie at 60 or 100 watts is even so high that the fluid over flows even if the utensil is not covered. even in the'keep worm' option the heat is so high that the content in the utensil boils and over flows. i have experienced the same problem in the PIC 15.0 model and returned the same to the supplier purchased through Amazon. I had faith on Prestige brand as i had been using its model PIC 1.0 for the last 7 years with out any problem. this PIC 20 model sleeps on the kitchen surface (on tile or granite) because it sits on plastic legs. The manufacturer have designed the back plate to rest on plastic points instead rubber.thus very disappointing.I have totally lost faith on Prestige and will not recommend any body to purchase this brand.

Prestige PIC 20,Madhura Hegde,Waste of money,2,Induction cooktop stopped working within a month after purchasing.
Prestige PIC 20,Krishnagiri Iyer,Poor design philosophy - PIC 20 Induction Cooktop,2,"They claim extended cooling technology - but forgot to install an automatic cut-off. Essentially, the device comes with a built-in fan for cooling. I already have PIC 12 model in which, after the heating is done, the fan runs for about a minute or so and automatically switches off. But in PIC 20, it never switches off. They claim it is 'extended cooling technology' and we need to wait another 5 to 10 minutes before switching off the device. Are they expecting us to use another TIMER to wait for 5 minutes? This is electronic-age, a simple timer they could have incorporated, if needed with a thermostat so as to turn off the fan at the right time. In short, I returned the item."

Prestige PIC 20,"Raj Ratan,VIZAG",Waste of money since delicate plastic .,2,Body is a cheap plastic material.when used for longer hrs it will melt especially when kept at 1200 watts power it will melt fast.dont kept at higer temp choose 800 watts it will be average heat that can be used as default setting.larger items shoulnt bear by stove since it's a delicate plastic preferably 3ltrs cooker us enough to bear the weight.otherwise if u use more than that this cheap plastic couldn't bear the weight.it will break surely at any weak part on the surface of the stove.

The product received on time, but when I start to use it, i noticed that the fan which is located at the bottom of the induction was not working.

Prestige PIC 20,Alexjo,Prone to Short Circuit - Use carefully,2,"Product is faulty and prone to short circuit! Its just 1 month of usage for me and if water touches the control panel or under it, then it will malfunction. It will be literally impossible to save the machine from water as during cooking it will get messy. The machine no longer works. One solution is lifting machine height by 1Cm so that water doesnt go inside and gives the fan more space to operate. Handle with extreme care, with no water spillages from your vessels."

The flavour is lost...when I want to boil a soup, it just evaporates the liquid rather than infusing the flavour. If you can see what I mean. Ya it would be ideal to take on a holiday to keep yourself from starving...but daily cooking? no way!"

Prestige PIC 20,Amazon Customer,Terrible service center and customer serivice,1,"am extremely dissatisfied with my recent purchase of an induction cooktop. My experience has been frustrating not just because of the product itself, but also due to the terrible customer service Ive encountered. Product Performance: The induction cooktop has been underwhelming from the start. It heats up slowly and does not respond well to temperature adjustments. Cooking is a hassle instead of a joy, which is what I expected. Service Center Incompetence: After experiencing persistent issues, I contacted the service center for assistance. Unfortunately, their response was far from helpful. They were dismissive and failed to provide any effective solutions. Customer Care Issues: My attempts to reach customer care have been equally frustrating. Ive faced long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and vague promises that have not led to any resolution. It feels like my concerns are being ignored. Lack of Follow-Up: I was assured multiple times that someone would get back to me regarding my issues, but I have yet to hear from anyone. This lack of communication is unacceptable. Overall Experience: This has been one of the worst consumer experiences Ive had. A product should come with reliable support, and in this case, neither the induction cooktop nor the customer service has met any reasonable standards. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this induction cooktop or the company behind it. If you value your time and money, look elsewhere."
Prestige PIC 20,DEEPA,Defective - Damaged Product supplied by the company,1,"The outer packaging by amazon was intact / properly sealed, but to my astonishment when I opened the inner packet, the induction plate was found broken [ picture 1 &amp; 2 ] on a close look on the outer box it appears it was a repacked item - as a white slip has been pasted to conceal the earlier recipient /buyer [ picture 3 ] and the box at both the ends were tapped with transparent cellophane tape multiple times instead of original tape with the name ' Prestige ' printed on it [ picture 4 ]. It is a total loss for me and demand refund."

Prestige PIC 20,Avinash,Stop working in 3 months . Dont ever buy it,1,"I had a disappointing experience with the Prestige induction stove. Initially, it worked fine, but after some time, the button used to decrease the temperature stopped functioning properly. This is a crucial feature for controlling heat, and without it, the stove becomes almost unusable for precise cooking. I expected better durability from a brand like Prestige. I don't recommend purchasing this product unless they improve the quality of the control buttons."

This is third time worst experience with Amazon never gonna buy anything from Amazon ."
Prestige PIC 20,Ashish Chandra,Worst Product,1,"This is the review after almost 1 year of purchase. In this 1 year we had got repaired 2-3 times and warranty is just a gimmick. First, induction top was got cracked by it's own within 4-5 months. As it is not covered under warranty we had to pay to get it changed. Second, one fine day it denied to get power on, the power supply was also conked off and that again doesn't comes under so called warranty, so, we have to pay again to get it working again. We had paid more then what we have paid for purchasing it in last 1 year. Product/ service is pathetic to next level. Avoid like anything."
Prestige PIC 20,Ajruddin Ansari,Product quality and service,1,"I'm writing to express my disappointment with the quality and service of your product.

I have taken it to the service center twice, there they fix it but then it starts working again, then I take it to my office or home, once it runs for a little while, then it breaks down and does not get warm at all. The service center people tell me to check the voltage at my place, I got it checked, the voltage of both office and home is fine, still I am facing this problem. I think there is some manifesting defect in it, which should be fixed or changed. I am tired of going to the service center again and again."

Prestige PIC 20,Anjum,Disappointing Experience with Prestige Induction Cooktop and Customer Service,1,"My experience with Prestige Induction Cooktop has been nothing short of disappointing. After only a few uses, the cooktop suddenly stopped working due to a spark at the back near the wire. The real frustration began when I tried to avail myself of the warranty service. Despite multiple calls to the Prestige customer care number, I have received no assistance. I was informed that the technician for my area had left the firm, leaving them unable to find a replacement. It's been over two month now, and I'm still without a working cooktop. With each passing day, my warranty period is getting over, and I'm left feeling helpless and frustrated. The lack of accountability and urgency from Prestige's customer service is unacceptable. Overall, my experience with the Prestige Induction Cooktop and their customer service has been extremely disappointing. I would caution others against purchasing this product, as the lack of support and service in case of issues is simply not worth the investment."

On 2nd day i started calling that guy but he was not picking up and then switched off his phone on 3rd. On 4th day, i called the service centre who send this guy to check but he told to call next day. Next day i called but he said that today i can't call the service person as today is Sunday and upon my questioning about the intention of the service person he straight away said to go and do the FIR. is this the quality of prestige product which stops working in 8 days and on top of that is this the type of service your service provider provides? Pathetic"

Lenovo LOQ,Ruthvik,Great Laptop.,5,"The battery life is gonna be bad, but its expected for this beast of a machine at this price point. It handles demanding tasks like RDR2, GTA5, graphic editing, coding, and high-quality video playback with ease, staying cool without any issues so far. Some games might complain about low VRAM, but thats an easy fix. The screen quality is excellent as well."
Lenovo LOQ,Manash Protim Borah,Best in the price,5,"No issues so far. Performance, looks everything is top notch. Yes battery life is a bit less but it's gaming laptop. If you care about battery life then you'll definitely have to sacrifice performance. After tweaking some settings I get about 3 hours of battery life. I'll update this review later."
Lenovo LOQ,PARAM,Great in this segment,5,So its been like 8 days since i have been using this laptop Its superb like i play valorant in this laptop and uts great like on average i get around 200 fps The size is a bit small as i had a 16inch priviously and it heats alot so i would prefer you to use cooling pad for give space for the fans below this the sound quality is bit downbut its okish The quality of material and svreen resolution is nice i mainly use it for gaming and for stad pro its works nice in it and the screen is 144hz so its smooth as butter In this price range i would aay its the best (i got it for 60k w sbi credit card) so i would say that you should go for it No problem faced till now used to lag a bit but its all good now!!
Lenovo LOQ,sourabh jadhav,Great gaming and overall laptop,5,Screen is superb...great for gaming no heating issues at all.....Value for money....Great looking 1 hand open and close....Weight is higher side...but cooling is great...I got it for 54k at this price point nobody offers 6gb Rtx 3050 graphic card and reliablity
Lenovo LOQ,Mr. Singh,Some doubts need to be clarified,5,"I have seen people are giving negative reviews to this laptop because of three major reasons they're facing with this machine so I just wanted to clarify that as it may mislead new buyers. 1 - Poor Battery Backup - Let me be honest with you, this is a gaming laptop and true gamers know it that you can't expect much in terms of battery backup from a gaming laptop. Hence it's always recommended to plug in charger while gaming as it won't only resolve your battery backup issue but also provides you the best performance. 2 - Brand is misleading you with RGB lights - That's entirely incorrect, it's nowhere mentioned in the product description or specifications that it has RGB lights in keyboard. People who are confused with 100% sRGB they need to understand that this feature belongs to your laptop screen not keyboard lights. it means that the display can reproduce a wider range of colors than the standard sRGB color space. In other words, the screen's color gamut extends beyond the boundaries of sRGB, potentially offering more vibrant and saturated colors so I appreciate Lenovo for providing such screen in budget oriented laptops. 3 - Blue Screen or BSOD issue - Well, this issue could be subjective or sensitive at the same time so I'll try to just share my opinion as I'm no-one to judge anyone..... Gaming industry is so advanced in the current generation and playing games unethically be it downloading pirated games or using cheat codes may bring that blue screen. I'm not saying that people facing this issue are really doing so but that's also one of the main reason for blue screen in gaming world. So please do gaming ethically. Or contact customer care of further support. PS - There's one piece of advice to hard-core gamers, Please call customer care and get your laptop charger upgraded to 230W brick as I'm also going for it soon. Because one genuine issue which actually exists with this machine is the battery drainage even after charger is plugged in. That's because of the 170W charger which you get along with this laptop which I believe does not produce enough power so 230W would be a right choice. Don't worry it won't impact the battery life coz 230W is the actual compatible charger and meant to be provided with this laptop so go for it as this upgrade is free. And most importantly, please do get your warranty upgraded and go for back to college offer for 3 years warranty and premium care along with additional 2 years accidental damage warranty. Spending few extra bucks (2999) for such expensive machine would be a perfect choice for 3 years peace of mind I know this review is long but needed to be shared to clear out the confusion, I'll be updating my personal experience with this laptop very soon after using it atleast for 2-3 months."
Lenovo LOQ,abisheik,About this laptop,5,"So far i researched all the laptops and all brand for last 2months each and everything and finally decided to by loq, iam a software dev i gone to stores and checked, finally during sale i bought online 1st thing is price, it is lowest price in market so far and others cant offer this price, because loq is most sale laptop so more quantity ,with less profit ,still they make profits due to more sale.thats y they able to offer less 2nd dell have 120hz display,hp have ddr4 ram, acer is good but service centers less in india, and asus price is higher, so among this loq is best so many says it has motherboard issue, let see, if i face i will update here, thing to keep in mind,loq offers 95tgp which consume more power and heat, same cpu HX ,if doing intense task like playing powerful games or tasks and also using in performance mode,it runs on max potential and in india basically temp is high so soldered things will melt and fails, fix (if playing high end games )i suggest to play in AC rooms and use cooling fans then it will work fine, this is common for all brand laptops ,but loq offering 95w and hx processor so board fail occurring,where others like acer 65w hp75w ,they restict those things ,my suggestion is try to use on AC rooms with cooling pad, if playing normal games like valo,gta5,etc then u can use normally without ac or cooling fans thanks guys (i used lenovo ideapad for last 7 years,finally battery dead now and 2times i bought new charger as wire got cutted and i played games for more than 5hrs and my lap was active for 12hrs) (this shows how durable lenovo is)"
Lenovo LOQ,Aryan pathak,"Best for Gaming, Editing, Multi-tasking, Coding etc.",5,"Everything of this laptop is top-notch.Loved the display, Sound, keyboard feedback, performance, sound etc. I had ordered the one with rtx 3090 (i5) and my main purpose of using was mostly editing on After effects,photoshop, gaming and a bit coding.This laptop handled everything very well as I was able to edit my videos in 4k smoothly and playing games on this LAPTOP will definitely impress you.Only thing is the battery which gives a backup around 3/3.5 hours and that too it has many modes like performance, quiet, battery saver etc so you can easily adjust in any mode according to your usage. Loved the creativity on the power button though won't spoil further if you are buying it you will definitely love that feature forsure.If you are looking for a good performance laptop under 60k or similar you should definitely go ahead with this laptop.It will easily manage all your tasks without any lag and it's definitely a 'VALUE FOR MONEY' for sure."
Lenovo LOQ,Ashwani srivastava,Beast Performance,5,I bought this powerful beast on 27 September and it's been about a month &amp; it is working like a butter smooth and it is delivering a beast performance while gaming GTA V and video editing at 4k 60fps . Im Loving It
Lenovo LOQ,Manjeet Singh,Best gameing laptop,5,Very nice laptop for heavy usage. Close your eyes and buy it
Lenovo LOQ,narayana,good one,5,"using from past 2months (jul 2024). so far it is good and excelent. no major complaints. one good thing is i noticed is - battery saver option when we connect laptop to a continous power supply, battery will not be charged fully (as a protective feature) which is lacking in my previous Hp pavillion. one negitive point- charging light is situted back ..which we cant able to see easily about the charging status. overall it is excellen hx processors (high performing) will generate heat....in all laptops..which is not a concerning point. overall it is an excellent product.worthy"
Lenovo LOQ,RAMALINGAM V.,good..,5,"good product, delivered on time."
Lenovo LOQ,"Worth Every penny, Just go for it!",The best in this price range,5,"Best display, Used premiere pro - Very smooth. There's no lag while playing games. It doesn't look like 100% gaming bulk laptop, It's 50-50 personal and gaming. Heating is there only while playing games and sometimes during editing videos. Performance is really good. Even the battery lasts for a decent duration. Speakers might be little issue in this, speakers are really low. 100% Value for money. just go for it. Got it for 55k in a sale with card offers."
Lenovo LOQ,Super product,Really good,5,Efficient
Lenovo LOQ,Dhruv Ahlawat,Good,5,"The media could not be loaded. Boots so fast and gameplay experience is just fantastic , don't expect battery backup more than 3 hrs , its a gaming laptop it is doing justice with that"
Lenovo LOQ,Sushireviews,Bang for Bucks!!,5,"The media could not be loaded. Superb performance. I am able to play Forza Horizon at ultra settings and Final Fantasy 7 remake also at max settings at 1080p. The laptop also remains cool most of the time and makes less noise. The display is really pretty. The only Drawback is the speaker. It is very very bad. One suggestion, you'll get around 400gb of ssd space and installing a game could get burdensome on the storage. If possible buy the 1tb storage version bec an additional ssd costs 6k rs. One Pro tip - Download Windows from the official microsoft website and do a clean install with your pendrive. this way you will get the system completly bloat free and will give you more storage space to start with (40gb+). You can later install all the drivers from windows settings and update the Nvidea drivers from the official website. Also, download the lenovo toolkit which will help you switching between balance and performace mode easily. The Ms office subscription that you will get with this can be returned to the system from microsoft store. And finally, Great laptop though. I'm loving it."
Lenovo LOQ,Ajay singh,Good,5,Good

Lenovo LOQ,Placeholder,Value for money,5,"Good performance. I play gta v then ride 4 shadow of the tomb raider in high resolution like 1080p I get good fps. I don't have faced issues due to the motherboard issue If I faced I will review here again Laptop was good for editing also you can do after effects , photoshop you can export to 1080p that is best in my opinion Sound quality is basic you can watch web series and movies or games. But if you're competitive gamer then buy headset Value for money you can go for it"

Lenovo LOQ,Rahul,Absolutely fantastic..,5,Go for it if youre looking for a decent gaming laptop. This is my 2nd lenovo gaming laptop in medium range. The previous one is 6 years old and still going strong. Gave it to my son to use now and I bought this one. Both I5 processors clubbed with Nvidia. You cannot go wrong with this configuration.
Lenovo LOQ,Atharva Khotpal,Powerful laptop,5,"The media could not be loaded. Experience after a week long use is good, GTA5 and Valorant game runs smooth. Heats up a bit but use a cooling pad. I mostly use Premier pro and Blender, which runs better with Display of 100%srgb . Overall nice machine."
Lenovo LOQ,Gopal S.,Value for money,5,"I liked it's performance. I can smoothly play competitive games like valorant, fortnite. Also story mode games like GTAV and assassin creed Valhalla on 1080p. Battery backup is less, which is expected in gaming laptops."
Lenovo LOQ,Placeholder,Amazing laptop for excellence performence,5,Excellent Laptop for gaming and editing purposes due to its amazing HX processor and RTX 3050 6gb Graphic card. However the latop might overheat if your atmorsphere is not chill during high usage. And also has low battery backup and needs charing to use in high power.
Lenovo LOQ,Amazon Customer,Lenovo LOQ,5,"Display quality, mid to upper range graphics, a must buy Lenovo laptop"
Lenovo LOQ,Saumyajit Sikder,Great Laptop,5,Except battery life evrything is fantastic
Lenovo LOQ,ToBeHonest,A reasonable choice despite some flaws.,5,"I bought this laptop after my Asus tuf laptop of 3 years old suddenly died with moderate usage. I've been using this laptop for just 2 days and have only tested one game(God of War 2018) at the time of writing this review. Pros:1. It is one of the most affordable rtx 3050 laptops. Most laptops at this price range come with gtx 1650 cards. RTX cards have DLSS support, which greatly boosts FPS and enhances gaming experience. 2. Good built and design. I personally love the minimalistic design language of this laptop. There is no screen wobbling, and the typing experience isn't bad either. Cons: 1.This laptop comes with 16 gb ram, but there is only one ram slot, so there is no room for a future upgrade. Also a missed opportunity for dual channel ram. 2. Below average battery life, but it isn't much of an issue for me because I always use my laptop plugged in for better performance and gaming. 3. Only two USB ports while the competition gives at least 3 ports. All in all, this is still a good choice in its price segment despite its flaws."
Lenovo LOQ,Ravi Singh,Best performance,5,"Attractive look, full battery life, best for gaming"
Lenovo LOQ,Babulal,Value for money,5,Fine in all aspects except battery

Lenovo LOQ,Amazcust,Amazing Price to Performance,5,It easily runs all games and softwares you throw at it and gives 120+fps in most AAA titles.the build quality is plastic but still pretty great. Thermals are amazing too and the GPU doesn't go over 65C. Overall amazing product Charging is pretty fast it goes from 0 to 50 in 30mins.Appearcence is pretty elegant and not gaming themed.It has blue highlights in vents.

Lenovo LOQ,Shakthivel.A,"Beast Performance, Worthy product. Go for it",5,"Performance is beyond expectations. i5-12450H + RTX 3050 + 16GB 3200MHZ (two slots 8x2) + 512GB SSD. Display is not that great, brightness and colour accuracy; for Gaming it would be fine. For content creators and graphic designers it wont be that great (Better to connect with a Monitor that has good HDR) No lag occured so far with my unit. I have been using Sketchup+Enscape rendering for architecture and interior design, works without any jitter. Build quality, silent keyboard, backlit, Lid opens wihout the base lifting as same as Legion design are Top positives. Dont forget to get additional warranty and accidental damage protection while buying cus you will get it around 2,999 worth 19k. Negative is just the display but that too wont feel like a major negative."
Lenovo LOQ,RanitR,Came from IdeaPad 320 to IdeaPad Gaming 3i Gen 7,5,"Satisfied with the gaming performance. Day to day tasks are also carried out very smoothly. Best pick in 70-75k price segment. I also shortlisted Dell g15 but the white color put me off. Ive been playing Gta V, Far Cry 6, Fifa 2022, Spiderman remastered, etc at high/ultra settings. Smooth af. For hardcore gamers, I think there are better options in this price bracket like MSI Alpha and others. You can also customize this laptop at Lenovo site by adding/ removing things like Office 2021, ram, etc. P.s. if you're planning for casual gaming alongwith day to day office/ student work, this pc is for you."
Lenovo LOQ,Raghav sharma,Worth the money totally,5,"The media could not be loaded. Its a wonderful laptop . I got it from appario limited for 79,990 as its original price is 1lakh+. Its speed is super fast and very much high technology provided by 12th gen. RTX3050 - needs no introduction i5 is suitable for all the coding requirement I have as Im a CSC student so I would recommend this to the students of course . 526gb ssd is enough , I wont say that its suffice if you are in gaming but if you only need for coding then full heads up . Very nice built body and design is just like a lamoborghini . Screen quality is awesome - 250nits . Keyboard is back lit looks so amazing ."
Lenovo LOQ,Jay Kumar Tomar,Quality product,5,"I received the Laptop under one day delivery. It delivered on everything I was looking for. Here are some things I found, Pros - great performance, does not lag no matter who heavy processing - the design is just great - heating vents are placed well too, does not heat easily - ram and storage is good (16gb, 512gb) - i5 11th generation might look slow, but it hasn't disappointed yet Cons - for gaming, it does not run that smoothly on battery - battery life is 4-5 hrs I would say; for general purposes you wouldn't feel that much of a problem - screen is not that great; just okay I would say"
Lenovo LOQ,Sportvot,Best product,5,Best product for used ..great service..keep it up.
Lenovo LOQ,Rajul Shukla,Beast at the price.,5,"So far so good, been using this for the last 6-7 days. I've done heavy gaming and it does heat a bit but the thermals of this laptop are quite good. The fans are really good and don't make much noise. It can run all of your heavy games at max or close to max settings. I got the 512gb and 16gb version at a bargain price of 64k. At such a price you don't generally get rtx 3050 with 16bg ram so overall this laptop meets on all the expectations. Even at 70k this is probably one of the best deals you'll get."
Lenovo LOQ,Ashima Sharma,Do your research before you buy,5,Very good for the price.
Lenovo LOQ,Piyush Sanjay Zope,Good product but check everything during delivery before giving OTP,5,All things are good. PPL who are purchasing should check all the packaging and start the laptop in front 9f delivery boy itself before giving OTP. Also check all the laptop and accessories and then start laptop then can give otp. After that check all software details and warrenty. It was showing 2 months less to me but it was not an issue because it was from manufacturing date so I contacted to Lenovo support and they extended it to 12 months as mentioned.
Lenovo LOQ,Amazon Customer,Good laptop for gaming,5,"Useful for all purpose like gaming, coding, virtual machines, heavy applications. Games tried till now Fifa 23, cricket 22, assassins creed origin, Hitman 3."

Lenovo LOQ,Gaurav,Good budget gaming laptop with great thermals,5,"Nice budget gaming laptop. Thermals of this laptop is very good and 4 fans keep the laptop cool even in non AC room and playing AAA titles without any problem. Design is also great and alike legion series. Lenovo vantage is useful and you can update various things like drivers, BIOS etc without any need to download it on other sites. Feature like battery conservation keeps the battery long lasting when you play games on AC power. Sound is little bit less but then I tried nahimic audio after which watching movies, playing music become so good due to various profiles just like it was there in Dolby in previous IdeaPads."
Lenovo LOQ,Shohrab,Best at this price point.,5,i got this at Rs. 58240..Best laptop at this price. Battery is not up to the mark..only last for 2 hours max coz its a gaming laptop. overall satisfied.

Laptop started crashing since a week, however it was getting restarted. 3 days back (&lt;2 months of usage), it crashed completely and not starting up. Filed a ticket to lenovo same day, some automated emails as of now, will update once I get it resolved. --------------------------------------------------------- Bought it in Prime day sale @60k with card discounts. At this price it is very good machine. 1. Performance (5/5) At this price, can't ask for anything more, both CPU/GPU are too good. Overall very fast responsive PC. I haven't tried ultra high graphics settings, but seems like 1080p gaming should run smooth. Ex. CS2 gives 200 FPS at default high settings in 1080p. 2. Battery (2/5) I ran a 480p video with battery saver on, ran for ~1.5h from 100% battery. There is a 'Quite mode' also, but it is unusable, makes PC very slow, videos also lag. And yes, battery drains (when connected) even with normal games. So I charge it atleast 50%, then can play for ~2 hours easily. 3. Portability (2/5) This is a major issue with this. If you want to carry this regularly, checkout ideapad or some other laptop. This is very bulky, and charger is heavy too (plus cant take it without charger). Not for daily carriage. I wont even recommend putting it on lap for long. Basically, use it like a desktop. 4. Boot Time (5/5) Start up, shut down both ~5 seconds 5. Display (3/5) Not very crisp, brightness is also little less. 6. Keyboard/Touchpad (4/5) 7. Initial setup (5/5) Some people have mentioned that they needed to re-install windows and all, I just did the windows update, and everything is fine. 8. Looks (3/5) I usually like simple look, but this is pretty boring for a gaming laptop. 9. Built (5/5) Sturdy build. Very confident that nominal heat or impact wont cause issues. Other issues: 1. Warranty was already used up for 1-2 months when I got it, maybe this is a returned product, but I didn't find any other issue, so kept it. 2. Sometimes the power button doesn't turn red/while when we toggle between performance/balanced mode."
Lenovo LOQ,Manjinder Singh,Good laptop in budget,4,"Speed and performance is good, no screen wobble issue. Gets a bit heated after 30 mins of normal gaming.built quality is good.speakers could have been little louder.i would say value for money spent.battery life is weak if played games, otherwise ok for everyday task@2-3 hrs,backlit is bonus no issues."
Lenovo LOQ,shivam soni,"Laptop was good, seller worst",4,"I am writing this review only about laptop as I have to return the product overall laptop was great yes it weight slightly on higher side ,powerfull processor, display good camera wasgood too, battery is not that great 2hr max on just YouTube streaming, otherwise a good buy."
Lenovo LOQ,R VENKATESWARA RAJU,Amazing,4,Supe
Lenovo LOQ,Ckdutta_05,Battery backup is less because it is a gaming laptop.,4,"Screen is good, Also very smooth to work, Little heating which is common for gaming laptop, I think value for money under 60k, Sound quality not good you have to use earphone or external speaker, Performance is on top level"
Lenovo LOQ,Amir Sohail Mallick,15 days review no issue,4,"Working like a beast, throw any AAA game at this and it will play 60fps above in medium settings and No Issue till date. Speaker sucks, mediocre camera it will get your job done, battery truly sucks you will get 3hrs of backup max with battery saver and every possible settings. So -1 star for battery. Still great laptop at 50k to 60k"
Lenovo LOQ,aman dobhal,Heating,4,Everything is good in this laptop good performance good display everything but heating issue within 30 min of gameplay laptop starts to heat but the good point is their is no drop in performance performance remain the same but i feel a little bit risk on this heating issue that component might get damaged in long session of gaming
Lenovo LOQ,Abhishek Chauhan,Battery life,4,"Overall very good laptop in 65000 budget but there is battery issue, battery drains very fast on 100 % charge it give you only 2 hours when only light work not heavy work like gaming it's a major issue"
Lenovo LOQ,Shivam,My First Gaming laptop,4,Laptop is very good and my laptop manufacture date is July 2024. And and hope so koi problem Na aaye aur July se pahle variant mein motherboard issue tha ismein nahi hoga very good laptop or bs laptop ko start krte hi windows update aa gya .
Lenovo LOQ,me,Amazon description is misleading,4,It's a good laptop for the price. 83GS003UIN check with this model specs in Lenovo website before buying. If it meets your needs then buy. It doesn't mention RGB keyboard in Lenovo website. But amazon description is misleading. Pros: Expected performance for the price with 3050. Good screen(bright enough 300 nits) &amp; colors . Linux support seems good. Although most of the lenovo software isn't available for it. Thermals seem good. I was able to run genshin at high graphics and record at the same time without hiccups. Good port selection for my needs Automatically switches between dedicated graphics and Nvidia optimus. Cons: Speaker is trash. Battery backup is trash. An AMD CPU would have been better You can still expect some frame drops occassionally for heavy games. Windows 11 setup was trash as always. I had to reinstall it. I use an external keyboard and headphone. So I don't really have issues with the non RGB keyboard and the sound quality. I'll say it's good for most people if you want a gaming laptop that runs good enough for most needs and has a good screen to look at.
Lenovo LOQ,Nishant Sharma,value for money,4,apart from the battery backup its a big yes for me weights heavier but certainly wont lack in performance a great deal indeed in this segment :)
Lenovo LOQ,Surya,Good product great package value for money let's wait I will put long term review to,4,"Likes Great build quality Good screen Hardware looks promising I have to check in long run Display looks great in indoor great crisp and quality. Value for money and well put together for this price Extended warranty and accidental damage protection in offer price Dislike Battery backup is below avarage No amenities like backpack, screen care nothing inside the package, only laptop and charger Little overweight and not easy in handling and rest on lap Not easy to carry on backpack bcoz of it higher side weight I will suggest this laptop who looking for in budget near to high performance around 50k best one and good reputation."
Lenovo LOQ,Aniket,Overall great product and value for money,4,Pros: rtx 3050 6gb I5-12450H cpu Great display AAA titles medium setting playable Cons:- RGB keyboard missing Thermal issue Average sound quality
Lenovo LOQ,Rituraj,Best Laptop for me but there is some Negative Point,4,"I have purchased laptop 1month ago. Performance is perfect. No lagging issue faced. Cooling is good because of hyper chember technology. Colour Gamut 100% sRGB , colours are accurate. But Negative Point is About Battery - when i play game PUBG, battery drops even on charging, in 10min 1% drops then i placed a complaint about this, next day support centre called me and they inspected my laptop via online and they replaced my charger 170watt to 230watt, now everything seems fine. No charge drops"
Lenovo LOQ,Parekh Rutvik,Best game are played smoothly,4,"Display &amp; performance is way better, but sounds bass are no powerful also comes with Dolby sound"

Lenovo LOQ,Jyotirmoy Talukdar,Every thing is perfect but the battery is not that good,4,I am hearing some cases of motherboard dead in the particular hx series laptop in which i am afraid of. Please help me with my fear as i invested a huge amount.
Lenovo LOQ,Placeholder,Good For Gaming Anonymous FF Kerala But Lowe Battery,4,The media could not be loaded.
Lenovo LOQ,Hemant,Good product,4,The only reason I'm giving this 4 star is it's battery backup. Not a good battery. Rest this is good to have laptop
Lenovo LOQ,Overall performance was so sorry good but the battery drains to fast I know it's gaming laptop but I used on quite mode while with battery saver and performing a web task still battery drains in 5 min 10% it's too much pleasure resolve the issue,It's was good,4,Overall performance was good but battery sucks .
Lenovo LOQ,Sivamani,NO RGB lights in Keyboard,4,Amazon is cheating there is No RGB Lights in Keyboard. Be aware guys
Lenovo LOQ,Shivaji Tupat,Lenovo IdeaPad,4,It's good for office work and for coding students or cs students and the main thing is the processor is Lil bit slow after sometime they laptop can carry work load and don't get heatup value for money laptop.
Lenovo LOQ,Abbas maak,Good product,4,"Been using it for 6 months now, its a good laptop."
Lenovo LOQ,Ritesh Vichare,Too many issues,4,"There are literally so much issues in this lap ,the 2 main are , when we change the mode of lap the indicator doesn't change its light 2 issues is everythime i login my laptop after long time the left fan doesn't work I have to restart it then it works lol"
Lenovo LOQ,Balakrishnan,Good,4,Good
Lenovo LOQ,Souvik,battary while plugged in gaming,4,"bought this last week from lenovo store but while plugged in gaming it dischargers the baytery too is anybody else having the same issue,?"
Lenovo LOQ,Subhash,"Best for the price range, just one exception.",4,"If you're looking for a multitasking laptop for a good price this is the one to go for, except the battery. The laptop itself is well performing under medium to high load but it comes with the drawback of low battery capacity, if it's just viewing videos, researching and notes, it should do well. While buying do keep this in mind, and if you can overlook this, then go ahead!!!"
Lenovo LOQ,Ashish Menon,Affordable laptop at these specs with a below par battery,4,"I got the 16GB variant 82K101EBIN from Lenovo exclusive store and have been using it for 1 week. Have tried playing Battlefield 1 and COD WWII, and COD advanced warfare till date with graphics kept at High settings. Can cause slight lag in the cutscenes if the graphics are kept at Ultra settings Pros: 1. Nvidia Rtx 3050 card at this price 2. Touchpad and keyboard quality and feel 3. Thermal performance 4. i5 Processor performance Cons: 1. Below average battery life 2. Screen brightness is below par 3. Seems to be a single channel 16GB RAM. Online brochure mentions there are 2SODIMM RAM slots and that the RAM can be increased only upto 16GB. So if you purchase the 16GB variant, don't know what purpose the 2nd slot will serve. Even the Lenovo store representative was unsure about this. 4. Hard drive space can run out easily in case you want to install multiple AAA title games."
Lenovo LOQ,Justin joby,Here everything is good expect battery,3,"Its value for money , and smooth , good screen quality.. but battery is good , high battery consumption.. Gaming for its good and good sound quality and performance.. Heat level is low .. high thermal cooling.. If you are buying for office use , don't buy it , if you using for gaming you can Full charge -5hr can use .. but if you use in gaming it's only for 2hr max That's all .. By a malayali.. Package is good .. and adapter is 170 buy 200 above (don't know exact)is better"
Lenovo LOQ,Tejas,Beware of terrible amazon customer support + update,3,"This is an updated review of the laptop. I will mention my original complaint at the end of the review. I have used this laptop for about a month and here are things that stood out: 1. The screen is dim. In a normally lit room, you'll be on 70-80% of your brightness the entire time. Not a major hassle but it is something to be aware of. However, despite being an anti glare screen, the colours are good and the images are sharp. I have had no complaints using it for games, youtube, movies or reading pdfs. 2. The config is powerful. I have used it for CPU and GPU heavy games and even on max setting it will squeeze out 60-70 fps. I am very happy with this however there are frame drops which happen semi-occasionally. It doesn't bother me very much and it could be a game optimization thing as well. One thing which you must do is raise the back rubber feet on the frame. It SIGNIFICANTLY improves airflow and thermals 3. The audio is pretty damn good and I do mean the speakers. With the built in Nahmic customizations, I got surprisingly loud and clear sound out of the laptop. I would recommend you try various modes and see what suits you best. 4. The laptop comes with multiple fan+ power modes and option to disable /switch active GPUs. In the quiet mode (lowest power consumption and silent fans) and disabling the Nvidia GPU, I could get nearly 5 hours of usage from the laptop. This was primarily using chrome to watch youtube and Netflix. If you are playing videos offline, it seems to last even longer but I have never tested it in that capacity for very long. 5. The build quality is sturdy as far as the main body is concerned but the screen, not so much. It wobbles a lot and feels like it could break easily. One thing to note is the weight is well balanced. Its a heavy laptop but when carrying it in a laptop bag, it's not as bad as I thought. 6./ Old Review. The wifi. This is the issue. The wifi works with my phone hotspot and a few other routers I tried with later on but refuses to work with my home router. Amazon was extremely unhelpful with this process. A technician was supposed to physically come to my house and check it and this never happened. They did an online check and just said the problem was resolved. Basically, my home router had to be reconfigured. I had to get in touch with Lenovo and their helpline and service center to finally iron out the issue. For a product worth 70k, it's very frustrating to be stuck in a limbo where they will neither replace your product nor help you with anything. It could have been resolved in 3days had Amazon actually been prompt. overall: Very decent laptop. It does everything it claims and does it fairly well, The screen could have been nicer though but that's basically it. I would rate the laptop to be a 4/5 but amazons terrible service was 1/5."
Lenovo LOQ,sunny,After 1 week review,3,Performance wise good Speaker sound is very low you won't be able to consume content on this laptop Weight is heavy
Lenovo LOQ,DEEPAK SHARMA,Don't buy,3,Please don't buy this laptop so many laggg I play gta5 after 5 mint stuck the game I have waste of money to buy this laptop

Lenovo LOQ,Hasan Naqvi,Good,3,"Few things won't be impressing Speakers, battery backup"
Lenovo LOQ,Anil Verma,About battery and speaker,3,Not good in battery and speakeer
Lenovo LOQ,Abhinandan Verma,Good for Work but Battery Backup Minimal,3,"Update: Aug 2024 (1+ year usage) : No issues from workability point of view, however, battery backup has gone down significantly in 1 year. I'm now getting max backup of around 1.5 hrs with only internet usage. No videos/music or games or any other kind of multimedia tasks performed, simple internet usage with real-time data updates, that's it. So that's not something I expected. Battery is a major drawback for this laptop. Other things are still the same and working perfectly. Old review (1-2 month usage): It's a very good laptop. The screen, processing, display, keyboard, all perfect for my work. If your work includes multitasking and working on multiple applications/software, this one may fulfil your requirements. But do note that it's NOT that portable, it's on the heavier side and may be difficult to carry if your work needs moving around or travelling. Battery life is very average kinds, given it's gaming laptop. With my work (involves running 1-2 processor heavy software and multiple browser windows with real-time data updates) I get max around 3-3.5 hrs backup. Connectivity is good, wifi 6 gives pretty good speed, ports are good enough to connect multiple things for work. Didn't use it for gaming, so cannot comment on that. Regarding McAfee which comes pre-installed. Don't use it, it makes this machine with 16 GB ram and 512 GB SSD feel like an old laptop from 2003-4 with 40gb hdd and 256 MB ram. Initially I thought there's some problem with laptop, but after uninstalling McAfee, it's working fine."
Lenovo LOQ,Sartaj Noorani,Faulty GPU,3,First 10 days was just fine but later it started to get black screen. Laptop keeps running just fine but the screen goes black everytime I turns on a game and exit a game. The GPU is faulty.
Lenovo LOQ,Sushil p.,There is no rgb keyboard in this laptop,3,No rgb keyboard
Lenovo LOQ,brightHTO,Fake advertising!!,3,The media could not be loaded. No rgb as adv
Lenovo LOQ,Sarath Kumar,Nice laptop but extended warranty not recommended,3,Nice laptop for the price point. Performance and heat management is great. Decent battery backup. Eventhough...not mentioned in the product description..for my laptop...the type c port on the back side supports display port. Rating 3 stars because of my experience with extended warranty option shown in product page. The extended warranty is not sold directly from Lenovo but through a 3rd party. My experience with this 3rd party was not good and they issued a refund after failing to get the warranty activated after waiting for almost a month. For extended warranty try the Lenovo official site.
Lenovo LOQ,Smit Panchal,Please do not go for this One,3,Worst product ever I have ever used not even value for money Its get Too much heating issues as well as lowest quality sound at this price point I would like to go for other products HP or dell
Lenovo LOQ,manikanta,Had a lot of grapics but not enough for basic video editing,3,"Most drawback trackpad, when i use it mouse is getting moved automatically itsself, it was the most irritating part in this laptop, i though i would be a software glitch but not at all getting cleared, im not sure how to get out of this issue . I think team Lenovo would solve my problem soon."

Lenovo LOQ,Krishna C.,Bad bad bad battery backup,2,2 stars only for the battery and customer support...Review after a little over 6 weeks. Battery backup is really bad. The battery drains @1%/ min. Neither Amazon nor Lenovo support helps in any way. I am tired of mailing and contacting them. They ask the same hardware reports that they already have with them. Do not buy anything from Lenovo

Lenovo LOQ,Amanktn,"My Lenovo LOQ 15 Laptop stopped working suddenly, no power",1,"I recently purchased this laptop on Amazon with EMI offers and was pleased with the delivery and product itself. I've owned a Asus TUF gaming laptop before and have a PC now, so this laptop was for when I travel and as a secondary system for streaming in the future. Just yesterday I was using the laptop as usual and it just powered off and when I pressed the power button there was no response. I thought maybe I had left the laptop running without charging it, but the power switch was on and it was charging. Since then it does not turn on nor does it charge and I know this because the charging light is off. Before I made this purchase I was afraid of dead motherboard or CPU issues with the LOQ series but after seeing several reviews was assured it was an isolated issue and would not happen with the 12th Gen i5 series. I use this laptop for watching YouTube, Netflix and occasionally gaming when I travel back home or when my PC has any issues. I have invoked product support with Amazon, since it is under warranty. P.S : I will be updating my review once Amazon and Lenovo support respond to it."
Lenovo LOQ,Atul Kumar,Not working,1,Bought it a month ago everything seemed fine and laptop was also working fine but after 1 month it suddenly crashed and won't start. raised a complaint in the lenovo website it took i week of chat support and emailing then i got the email saying that the part is not available right now after the part was available it was delivered to the service store and then the technician was supposed to come to fix it still haven't heard anything from them and waiting even escalated the issue as it was mentioned to escalate it if i don't here anything from the technician there hasn't been any resolve till now and still waiting
Lenovo LOQ,harmandeep singh,"Worst laptop to buy for 60 k , go for hp and Asus",1,The main problem in this laptop are 1- battery drains out very fast ( max 1 hr on low usage) 2- lags a lot without doing any heavy work . On normal usage like opening apps etc it takes to much time . So please don't buy Lenovo it's only showing we give you this and this in components but it doesn't work .

Lenovo LOQ,Near to expiry date,Dont buy,1,Dont buy this at all. Facing severe charging issue and touch pad stopped working properly within less than 2 months itself. It is not at all worth at this price.
Lenovo LOQ,Arindam,Recieved Defective Product,1,"The box wasn't sealed; someone opened it before. Inside the box, the product wasn't covered with plastic, and instruction foam was missing, which should be placed in between the display and the keyboard. The system also isn't running, giving a blue screen every time and restarting. On the screen, there are white spots. Now, in a new laptop display and motherboard both are defective, but Amazon didn't provide me a replacement. When it is under 7days replacement, they did some investigation and offering me Return and Refund. I have communicated with the LENOVO; now they are replacing the display and motherboard. The seller must be aware of the defects; that's why the seal is absent there. She also delivered this to another person before, when it got returned, then again delivered it to me. Never experienced this kind of situation before with the Amazon. Now I will rethink before buying something from the Amazon."
Lenovo LOQ,Sridevi,Service request not completed,1,I received the product. I claim the low battery backup issue. Service Engineer didn't visit till now. But message received as service completed and issue resolved on 20/10/2024. This is cheating.

I strongly advise against buying this laptop."

Lenovo LOQ,Amit Kumar,Customer Service is extremely BAD,1,"I had an absolutely horrendous experience with Lenovo customer service. My laptop is under warranty for home service, and I filed a complaint over a month ago. Instead of resolving my issue, they have been giving me excuses and are now completely ignoring my calls and emails. They are blatantly ignoring every attempt I've made to get in touch with them. My laptop has a simple issueit won't turn on. If I take it anywhere else, they'll claim the warranty is void. But when I reach out to Lenovo for help, they offer no assistance whatsoever. This is the worst service I have ever encountered. Do not buy any Lenovo products. I will ensure that I never purchase anything from them again."

Screen will stuck you can't do anything but force restart by holding power button. I lost my all applications, settings and data for fixing it. Waste laptop with somuch headache. If you already purchased it, then don't update the bios. Lenovo pushed it but don't update it in your machine. If you want to upgrade ram then you have to buy 2 16gb ram sticks which will almost cost you 11k to 12k because it is ddr5, they send machine with 8gb sticks instead of 16gb stick."

Lenovo LOQ,Asif Shaikh,Nightmare,1,"I purchased the Lenovo Loq laptop in October 2023, hoping for a reliable machine, but it has been nothing short of a disaster since day one. Heres a rundown of the issues I've faced: 1. Overheating Problems: The laptop heats up excessively even with basic tasks, making it uncomfortable to use and likely shortening its lifespan. 2. Display Issues: From flickering screens to outright blackouts, the display has been incredibly unreliable. I never know when it might decide to stop working. 3. Battery Woes: The battery life was abysmal from the start, and now, just months later, it's completely dead. Im forced to replace it out of my own pocket despite being under warranty! 4. Charging Nightmares: Even when the battery was functional, the charging process was inconsistent and frustratingly slow. Customer Service Nightmare: - Despite these glaring issues occurring well within the warranty period, Lenovos customer service has been shockingly unhelpful. - Denial of Replacement: They outright refused to replace the laptop despite its numerous defects right out of the box. - No Assurance: When I requested some form of assurance that future problems would be addressed, they flat-out denied any commitment. - Warranty Extension Rejected: I even asked for a simple one-year warranty extension as a gesture of goodwill and confidence in their product, but they dismissed this request as well. Conclusion: I am utterly disappointed and frustrated with Lenovo's Loq laptop. Its clear to me now that all the positive reviews I read must have been fabricated or written by users who havent experienced the true horror of owning this machine. If you value your money, time, and sanity, do NOT purchase this laptop. Lenovo has shown no regard for quality control, customer support, or honoring their warranty commitments. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for a laptop that wont leave you regretting your purchase from day one."

Sound does not crack, even at high volume and the experience u get via listening is indescribable. Thumbs up from my side. You should definitely go for it!!"
boAt Stone 650,TAVISH,Best product under this price,5,Best price product
boAt Stone 650,LJM,"Sound, value for money, compact.",5,"I loved this product. Now after 4 years of use, it has a problem with the charging port. But for 4 years, it has worked efficiently. I like that it has its own volume feature, so we get louder sound by phone and speaker separately. The sound quality is sharper especially when compared to other speakers in this range (value for money). Can carry easily all over the house and for outings."
boAt Stone 650,Rohit,Good,5,Value for money
boAt Stone 650,Gopi,Finest audio,5,"Boat stone 650. The speaker look is so elegant and easy to hold and carry. The audio is finest and crystal clear. The speaker gives its best bass and clarity, but since it is small speaker, the bass vibration can only felt if we touch the surface where it is placed. Overall audio is good for soft music listening. Audio volume is decent and covers entire home. For outdoor the volume may not be that great, but it can cover a small area. Drawbacks: 1. The dog voice that barks when powering on, pairing and powering off is bit wierd , instead they could have given a music tone. 2. When answering calls, the speaker goes on its maximum volume and unable to control using phone volume button or speaker vol button. So literally it's not usable in answering phone calls as it is too loud."

boAt Stone 650,YASH GHELANI,POWER PACK WITH A PUNCH THOUGH POCKET FRIENDLY SPEAKER,5,"Initially, when I thought of buying a speaker, I had in my mind that I wanted to go for portable &amp; pocket-friendly speakers, with punchy bass (I'm a bass head), descent loudness, and clear vocals. Searching through the net and Youtube for some days, I came to a list of some speakers: Boat Stone 650, Tagg Sonic Angle 1, Boat Stone 350, Boat Stone 1000, Mivi Roam 2, Portronics Sound Drum &amp; Breeze, Mi Speaker, Boult Verve, Boat Stone 190F and Boat Stone 1200/1200F. Considering my needs of Portability, Punchy Bass, Descent Highs and mids &amp; Pocket Friendly, I finally made a decision to go with the all time classic and Boat's Bestseller product BOAT STONE 650. It's actually a Stone, the box itself had weight, promising of a Good Sound. The speaker is Ruggid, the upper designed grill looks super classy, there are 2 5W speakers (Total 10W output) in the front and at the rear houses a bass radiator whose Thump you can feel which listening to EDM and poppy songs. I had not expected this at all, Very Impressive, So loud, Super bassy, clear vocals, no distortion when playing at high volumes. Boat has really packed in Punch in this speaker at the cost they are giving at. I bought it at 1,500/- Rs. I am very much satisfied by my decision to go with the Stone 650, I would surely recommend this to all the budget buyers, close your eyes and go for this speaker, it will not disappoint you. Do check out their review on the Youtube, I will recommend watching reviews from (Purecast9, Gogi Tech, and Indori Explorer)"
boAt Stone 650,Anindya Sundar,Value For Money,5,"I was really impressed by the boat stone 200's performance, it encouraged me to buy this one. Actually I was gonna buy the boat stone 700, then this one showed up in my search. It has bigger speakers than the 700(+0.5inch I think), and this is a newer model. It has water &amp; dust proofing like the 700 but doesn't mention of shock-proofing. Two 5watt (same as 700)speakers are very good at sound quality, bass is satisfactory, very less amount of distortion when volume is maximum. Loudness is as you can expect from 10watts of speakers. Battery lasts about 6hours for me, it depends on how you use. (while similar wattage speakers from Sony or JBL has much better battery life, also they are expensive). Charging the battery fully takes almost 3hours using some 5W or 10W charger, don't know why but my 24W fast charger cannot charge it(will update if it works). Looks good and durable as sides are covered with rubber materials. Sometimes doesn't show battery usage on my phone which has android marshmallow but android 8 phones show it properly all the time. Whenever I tried to connect using the aux cable some weird noise comes out of it until some audio is played and it is really irritating. However within 2k price range the quality its providing is really pleasing. So far I am happy that I've bought this one."

boAt Stone 650,Yadhu,Awesome sound quality and loudness!,5,"I've been using this speaker for quite some time now. I have to admit that I've not felt any issues with this speaker at all. The sound quality is superb and it's plenty loud too. The only problem I can say(which is not actually a problem) is that the black color becomes a little rusty over time...it still doesn't affect the sound tho, so it's fine... it's just a minor appearance issue. But if you can overlook this, then this speaker is the best damn speaker in this range!"

Hi, I am Sekhar I had lots of questions when I have a plan to buy Bluetooth speaker, i thought to go for Marshall but it is out of my budget &amp; very expensive. I have researched, googled &amp; investigated to the core for best output with decent price. After all reviews I have decided to go for it, trust me i was very much satisfied with built &amp; sound quality. I love listening to music in this Boat Stone 650 Bluetooth speaker Sound quality - Connectivity - Bass &amp; output - Battery Life - Built in Quality-"
boAt Stone 650,Lalit y.,"Start rusting after 6 7 months , especially in monsoon",5,"Battery- 5/5 Sound quality -5/5 Bluetooth connectivity -4/5 But it started rusting after 6 7 months during monsoon when there is a little bit of moisture in the air ,which shows the poor paint quality .The product will seem like 5 6 years old . I am also very dissatisfied with the service of boat bcz I claimed warranty on 21st july and I recieved my product on 2nd september(after 42 days) and my warranty claim was also rejected.They doesn't include outer layer rusting into warranty despite of the fact that it is a manufacturing defect. At last i can say that my experience with boat is worst ."
boAt Stone 650,Stephen Kims,The boAt stone 650 wireless bluetooth speaker,5,"Thanks Amazon for this superb product! The boAt Stone 650 wireless Bluetooth is superb and built in sound quality which is balanced and upto the notes of every sound played right from low to top. I must say, this young guy, is a beast of its own world of music and that, in him, there is thumbing bass, balanced with stereo. In other words, all notes are balanced accurately, there is no need of worrying, take with closed eyes. Bluetooth is very fine and can connect anywhere as long as he is not between walls. You can take with him at the beache, small parties, birthdays, and long journeys too. This guy is also fit for a student who needs peace of mind through music. This piece is absolutely perfect for you! It also comes with a USB charging port and connectivity of the wire used to connect either smart phones, laptops, whatsoever the case, as long as there is connecting port, there you are all set! This guy is water proof and dust proof, put him anywhere, he can prove to you that he can still stand,even in rough places, the guy still stands! however, I request, though he is tough, please take good care of him to serve the master for a long period of time. Battery so far is really good, and there are no problems on that. It takes 7 good hours none stop play and forth music and watching movies. But, gamers, this is not the right product for you, if you are looking for serious gaming sounds in background."

boAt Stone 650,Jahid,Crazy loud...,5,"Pros: 1. It is crazy loud. You can almost use it in a mini house party. And the distortion isn't too much at 100% volume. 2. The battery backup was good enough for me. 3. The sound quality is awesome. One of the best in this range. 4. The build is super classy. It's got just the right weight and shape, and those patters look really cool too. Plus it's full metal build with rubber sides so pretty secure too. 5. It supports SD, and AUX input too. 6. It comes with a mic for hands free calls Cons: 1. It's a bit too loud at lowest volume. I mean it's good, but I wish it was a bit quieter. 2. Those commentaries are so annoying. Every time I turn it on or off, connect or disconnect the speakers, I have to tolerated that corny voice. It's the weirdest thing about this. 3. The cable quality provided in the box are okayish(This is totally neat picking at this point)"
boAt Stone 650,sabitha,Sound Quality is awesome,5,"This was a second purchase the first boat speaker I ordered was not properly.. it was torn and I felt it was nit the first hand product so I retuned and purchased another one.. was bit nervous about the product but this time.., the product came in an amazing packaging and the quality was also amazing.. and happy with the product"

boAt Stone 650,Lenin G.,"Excellent bass, Good vocals and lows... Go for it if u get it under 1600 rs",5,"It's best among the segment.. I got it for 1499 rs in great Indian sale... If u r confusing btw boat grenade, grenadex XL, stone 650... Go for boat stone. 650 if u r a bass lover, if u love the clarity in vocals and crispness... Go for boat grenade or grenade xl...grenade had mono speaker of 5 Watts, xl has dual 5 watt speakers, both has passive radiators.. Both these grenade's have crisp and clear vocals the sound u get in these grenade's are so clear u will definitely fall I love with it.. Keep in mind the price point of both. [mids and lows are excellent] bass is also good but not as great as stone 650 which makes the party boom... I personally prefer high bass speakers.. So I've chosen 650.it has dual 5 watt speakers and 2 passive radiators (for extra bass) ..at high volume some times the vocals get distorted [not all songs. Only few,] in spite of that it's a good speaker. Built quality is great, controls are easy comes with SD card support Cons.. Some what heavy around 650 gms.. So keep in mind it's not that much suited for tours.. There no pendrive support.."
boAt Stone 650,Rishikesh,Best Quality,5,Actually boat maintain theirs product quality. Sound quality is good. Battery backup is good. Awesome product you can buy.
boAt Stone 650,Syed Shahbaz ali,Best Bluetooth speaker Under 2000/- in 2020,5,"I'm writing this review After using the 'Boat Stone 650' for 10 days. I've purchased also purchased 'Portronics Sound Drum' but returned it coz the 'Bass' was not that good &amp; if I go to 80-90% volume, it starts distort, etc Let's Talk about 'Boat Stone 650' : 'Built Quality' and the material used in the speaker is very good: 5/5 'Battery Backup' is really good, It'll last around 7 hours at 60-70% volume and around 4.5-5 hous at Max volume So- 5/5 Sound Quality: Lows - 4.5/5 Mids - 5/5 Highs - 4/5 Sound is very Crisp and Clear ,But the Highs should be better. Bluetooth Connectivity: It has Bluetooth 4.2 which is good ,but the range is not that much good as it should be. Price: I got this speaker at 1999/- which is really good. Verdict: If you're looking for 'Good Quality' Bluetooth speaker which looks Really Good and that produces 'High-quality Balance sound' under 2000/- than Definitely go for it. Note: Don't compaire it with speakers like 'JBL flip 5' or Sony xb32 coz they cost 4-5 times. At 2000 bucks this is a Great speaker."

boAt Stone 650,Rohit,Worth the price.,5,"I am not super impressed with the sound quality, but at the same time i purchased it for 1.5k and whatever this has to provide is definitely worth that, hence the 5stars. Pros: 1) Sound is definitely very clear, I am not an audiophile but i feel there's definitely negligible distortion at medium volume. 2) Bluetooth range is good enough. 3) Loudness: Don't worry about it. 4) Build quality: Impressive really. 5) Battery: Lasted me for 10 hours atleast at medium volume. Cons: 1) I like punchy sound, i am a Sony fan, this falls a bit flat, it appears more of a mono than a stereo. 2) Bass is just okay, people saying it has great bass are definitely not bass fans. Keeping portability in mind, this is definitely a bang for your bucks especially if you are getting it at a discount, don't expect to be blown away at this price!"
boAt Stone 650,Pooja,Performance,5,This product is a good option in this range . Base and volume both are doing there job well. You can carry it with you its not that much large and not small.
boAt Stone 650,arka mandal,Worth a buy!,5,"I got this product on an offer at 1499 INR which is really a good deal. The sound quality is very good and balanced. Bass is optimum which is a good thing (high-level bass is sometimes annoying and does not suit all genres of music). Battery back up is also very good (I saw 5 movies in a row with a volume level of 60-70%). Overall the sound is very crisp and one can easily distinguish several layers in the music. Works very well with Bluetooth as well as auxiliary cable, however, I have not checked with an SD card till now. Therefore, it's a must-buy if your budget is low and you get this product below 2000. Boat has improved its quality over time like anything."

Trust me if you want to arrange a party it can make the environment. Sounds is so cool and great bass . Only Drawback of this product is battery backup.. if you play it at 100% volume the battery will laste around 3-4h.

boAt Stone 650,Amazon Customer,Very useful,5,"The speaker is good and connects quickly. The battery time is also good and it gets charged within a couple of hours max. The mike is clear and the output sound is perfect. Very useful for audio calls, meetings, music play etc. Overall a very good product, though it is a tad too heavy. One improvement I would suggest is to have the buttons outside and provide better quality of switches."
boAt Stone 650,Prinkal,Loud and rugged,5,"First time tried boat device and its really impressive, its loud and has punchy bass, good vocals and mids. Anyone can go for it. Looks premium product."
boAt Stone 650,Krithika,Excellent speaker,5,Playtime is fair enough. Sound and bass quality are excellent. Looks classy and rocking. I would 100% RECOMMEND BUYING.
boAt Stone 650,Abhijit,Sound is more balanced and soothing compared to the Boat Stone 1000.,5,"To me this speaker sounds much better than the Boat Stone 1000. The highs are pleasant up till around 80% volume. Vocals are clear and crisp. Bass is good enough considering the size of the speaker. I haven't had enough time to test the battery life thoroughly, but I have been listening to it on and off since charging it to 100% yesterday. And I must have listened to it for 3 to 4 hrs in total at varied volume levels around 30 to 60% and it still shows 70% battery capacity. I comfortably get around 8 to 10 meters of bluetooth coverage with no breakage in the sound/connection. The build is rugged. Max volume is loud enough to fill a large room. But I wouldn't play it at more than 80% of the volume as it sounds a little stressed above 80 to 90% volume."
boAt Stone 650,Honey,Buy it right now !!,5,I wanted to purchase a Bluetooth speaker so after lot of research i ended up buying this. I can't tell about other options available in market but i can tell you about this product and believe you won't regret. This is just simply mind boggling speakers. They have bass they have trebles sound is amazing. Battery back up is also nice( at high volume it suck juice quite rapidly but still it is amazing) sound is the main thing and that will definitely blow you away. No distortion on high volumes as well as low volume. You can feel every bit of music. I got it at 1000 bucks and there no other option in this price range that can beat this beast.
boAt Stone 650,Tanveer Mabood,Budget king,5,A mini home theatre I can call it. With a loud sounds its a perfect for home party or small get together . 10 W output sounds its actually quite loud with clear sounds . Connectivity too simple . Just in mic call sometimes it lacks but most times it works perfectly . But with aux there is no issue for in mic call . Nd more for music this is definitely a recommendation . I bought it for 1499 in Amazon great India sale .in normal time its cost between 1999 to 2199 .at this price it still a worthy but for its loud music .but I think in great India sale you should look for it if you need a compact speaker at a great price .
boAt Stone 650,Priyajit Pattanaik,Time to go for a Indian company.,5,"Here I'm going to compare between Tag sonic angle1 &amp; boAt STONE 650. Pro's -sound quality is far better than Tag. -sound is more sweet than tag(harsh voice) -Bass quality is better than tg -looking is better than tag &amp; you can place it like vertically or horizontally -price is low Con's -as I posted the picture of the cable of aux &amp; charger.. Both are short than others.. -heavy (u feel it like a dumbel) . ...... After all both speaker hve same Bluetooth connectivity.but sound quality is best in boAt.. I hve been using tagg for 1.5yrs &amp; boAt for 6days, then I reviewed both of this.. What gives me more pleasure is that I got this boAt 1699/-(Red one) which is far far better than tagg(2300/-).. After all tagg is a Chinese company &amp; Boat stone is a Indian company.. So choice is yours. Thanks for reading this."
boAt Stone 650,yogesh verma,Awesum,5,Jabardast product thank you Amazon.
boAt Stone 650,Raj,Perfect for daily usage.,5,"Writing this after using for 7 hrs straight post being delivered today. Played some work-out music on Youtube, watched few episodes of a season, and a movie. Its just right in all aspects: Bass is HD and the speaker gives a surround sound effect and is immersive. Vocals are pretty good and clear and sound fills up and is good for a normal size bedroom. Its a steal at 1499 and is better than available competition at the same price point. Portability is good however only issue could be its weight but its not like you are gonna hold it and play and however its good enough to be carried anywhere easy. Verdict is 5 stars from my side."
boAt Stone 650,sid,great speaker,5,the sound quality is really great.
boAt Stone 650,Sohom Chattaraj,Great sound thanks to Boat,5,"Great sound..... I didn't think it is going to be that good. I bought this product by watching public reviews and it's really a good product value for money, quite heavy though. Got it in sale and it worth every penny.... But the packaging from Amazon was very very bad. I bought 2 products from Amazon at the same time and they just put both of them in a same normal plastic seal package without wrapping it up in a bubble rap and so it damaged my other product because this speaker was heavier than my other product. I was lucky that it didn't broke any of my product. This was not expected from Amazon at all... Hope they don't repeat this next time."
boAt Stone 650,Gaurav Negi,Sound quality awesome,5,I write this review after using several months almost year. The sound quality is too good never disappoint me. But i feel that battery should be good overall best Bluetooth speaker in this price segment. Goo for it.
boAt Stone 650,ANWESHA G.,Awsome sauce!!,5,I got more than i expected. Glad i chose boat. Its worth its price and weight (its a bit heavy like a 1l water bottle). Awsome sound wonderful bass. Atleast its perfect for me. It gives a full and clear sound and doenst have overwhelming bass. I've been using it for 2-3 months now. The battery life is great i haven't used it up in one go but i expect it'll last aleast 7hrs. Bluetooth connectivity is great too if u stay in the same room. Connects with my non-smart phone too. The volume is utterly satisfactory as in it'll perform to perfectly in a house party if people are in the same room. The sound fills the room.

boAt Stone 650,Arkodit,Its a bang for the buck !!!,5,"A real value for money from BOAT. I have been a BOAT brand loyal customer for some years now, primarily using there earphones/headphones. When was in the search for my first portable Bluetooth speaker, I had my eyes set on the 'boAt Stone 650 Portable Wireless Speaker' and let me tell you, its worth the hype. The sound quality is really good, especially the bass, blue tooth connectivity is really strong and it is the definition of 'Portability' Bottom line: If you are within a budget of 2K, go for it, eyes closed."
boAt Stone 650,Gaurav purandare,Very Nice Bluetooth speaker in this Range,5,I have ordered these speakers about a month back. This is my first Boat product. I can say is i am very impressed with the performance of this bluetooth speaker. The sound is crisp and clear even at high volume the sound didn't get distorted and all nodes and beats are clearly audible. Add to that it comes with auxiliary cable which makes it more flexible to connect. It is highly portable device and u can carry it anywhere. Battery capacity is also very good . Nice product to go buy in this range.
boAt Stone 650,Vivek B.,Boat is all time greatest,5,Good experience.
boAt Stone 650,Kundan kr...,Good product under 1399,5,"Good and clear sound with average base (playing with vlc media player in normal Equalizer, volume 70%)... (Good product under 1399)"
boAt Stone 650,saravana keerthan,Awesome.....,5,"I've bought this speaker 3 months before... After using for the above said period, i recommend everyone who wants to buy a portable speaker... Its really good at everything... Sound effect is really good particularly bass.. Some might think if bass is high, there will be no clarity in sound but this thing will break all your myths.... I'm using it like a home theatre for my small room... Its not an exaggeration.. High sound effect with clarity.. Just buy it, u won't regret it."
boAt Stone 650,Deadpool,Super awesome speaker...!!,5,"This speaker is simply the best n most awesome speaker i have ever seen Under this price u won't get better speaker than this n so much premium look. I just fell in love with this speaker , its build quality, its design, its premium look and last but not least its weight. Its not heavy but weight it has just shows its quality n premium nature. Bcoz of its superior design n weight it just feels awesome told it in hands... Sound n bass are awesome Stability is also good. I bought it yesterday n battery still hasn't drained yet after using for 5 hrs continuously n bluetooth range is also good n nice connectivity."
boAt Stone 650,Keval Jain,Go for it without second thoughts,5,"Been using it for more than 1.5y now, never gave any issues, sound quality is good, music movies can enjoy, for gaming don't use bluetooth, use aux connection"
boAt Stone 650,Anamika,Loved it,5,"Color: blue One of the best buys. The sound quality and clarity are amazing. The weight is a bit heavy due to battery. Once full charged, continuous entertainment for 8 long hours. Obviously the battery life will reduce with time. AUX,sd card facilities available aling with bluetooth. If your network is slow or the phone dies,simply load your all time favorites in a sd card and here it goes. Quick bluetooth connectivity. Overall it performs good. If you want a good speaker in reasonable or budget friendly price you should go for it without a doubt. Thanks Amazon for speedy delivery."
boAt Stone 650,Prasad,Best Bluetooth speakers in this price....boom boom,5,Thanks boat and Amazon for giving such a wonderful product. Sound quality is excellent .when i connected to mobile sound quality was good but when i connected to laptop sound was best of best....because laptop has addional drivers . Volume was so loud that i cannot make it full level. I anyhow taken volume to full level then also sound was so soft .it did not break or torned. I was as pleasant..happy with the product. Bluetooth range is also good. While charging we can play the music Battery capacity awesome . No fast drains seen . Overall best product. Go for it
boAt Stone 650,Satya,Worth giving it a try,5,"Overall I liked the product. I am not a fan of its diamond cut though. Battery backup is good and so is the sound quality. It takes lots of time to get it fully charged though and there is no clear indication when it's fully charged by thank God there is for low battery. Not sure if it's normal or manufacturing issue with my product, the sd card slot is outward facing. Hence taking out your sd card is quite difficult. I think these two things can be improved."
boAt Stone 650,VSMS,Sound Quality : Boat Stone 650 vs Nakamichi Speck vs Boat Stone 200,4,"This is review is primarily focused on sound quality. The term Bass is used losely. One doesn't expect true Bass from such small drivers. SHORTER VERSION: Boat Stone 650: Very loud. Loud and somewhat uneven bass. Mids are a bit supressed. Somewhat muffled midrange. Decent treble. A loud bassy speaker. Nakamichi Speck: Barely louder than the 3W Stone 200. Mids clearer than 650. Bass much much lower than 650. If looking for VFM rule this one out, unless this is on a big discount and others aren't. Overall fairly even sound, at a questionable price and volume. Boat 200: More bass than expected of a tiny 3W speaker, but lesser than Speck, and way lesser than 650. Excellent midrange and terble. Much lounder than what you may expect of a 3W speaker. Amazing speaker in a tiny package, with insufficent bass. LONGER VERSION: I have had the 200 for years and many have asked me to order it for them. It is an excellent tiny satisfying package. The midrange, vocals and treble is excellent, and matches speakers several times it price. If bass is not what you are after, you are unlikely to find a better package even at a much higher price point, especially if you care for even sound. (By Even Sound, I mean all relevant frequencies produced fairly well - no major suppression or enhancement) I checked the others as I usually hear music on a semi-pro system, and the insufficent bass (lower-mids) bothered me. Nakamichi USED to be a Japanese company making very high end tape decks in the 90s so the benchmarks were high (now it is a China based company). The 25W raised expectations further. As said, it is barely louder than the 3W Stone 200. It is fairly even sound, but not a significant enough improvement in bass over the 200. If you don't care about the money, and want something better, than the 200 with even sound, this could be it. The mids and terble, are a tiny bit better in the 200. Speck also has a larger battery, giving substantially longer backup, and better water protection (useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house :) ) The Stone 650 is miles ahead in bass and loudness. if that is what you care for, amongst the 3 - your choice is simple. The bass is uneven, however. All three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators. One should not expect much nuance in bass from those. If a thump is what you care for - yes it is certainly there (for the size). With somewhat uncontrolled bass, the midrange is compromised - somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled. No, it is not major, and many mgiht not even really notice it much. The transiton between mid and lower-mids/bass isn't great. One usually doesn't expect as much from such speakers, but the Boat Stone 200 set the bar high - very high. Keep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers (speaker) are in the direction of your ears. It makes the midrange a bit better. Reduces the bass a bit, but makes the sound more even. Tough it is impractical to keep it so, it makes the sound a lot closer to what I desire. SOME EXTRAS: Placement of these speakers makes a big difference. Keep them about 6' away from a wall (ideally a corner) for enhanced bass and fuller sound. If you look at teardown videos, you'll notice that the 650 has much bigger magnets than the others. It is a heavy speaker. I like that, since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further. It is well designed, except the + and - volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive use. The 650 can also be placed vertically. That too changes the sound. Lesser bass, and possibly a bit clearer on the whole (reduced bass = less intrusion into the mids, in such speakers) Speaker characterics change subtly over 100 odd hours of use. Often quite prominent in the first hour, so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hour. Conclusion: Nakamichi Speck: More even sound than the other two, not at all as loud as expected, better waterprof rating, bigger battery, high priced, despite Chinese - Buy if you don't care for the money, volume and are okay wihtout much bass. Boat Stone 200: it is a star! Excellent even sound, however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back. If you are on a budget, or if you don't care much for bass (especially for lectures/documentaries or vocal music) this is brilliant. I have used it for long. Boat 650: Heavy. Loud. Lots of bass. If you can deal with the somewhat (and it is not big) unevenness and slightly muffled sound - it is a good package. For my needs, I added the 650 to my equipment list, while keeping the 200. PS: This was my way of giving back to the community for the numerous reviews I have gained from."
boAt Stone 650,Honest Review:**,Quality speaker,4,"This is not much louder speaker but this is a quality product, its sound quality and its bass is well enough satisfied for a user. Yes this is a value for money product under 1500."
boAt Stone 650,Akshat,Boat stone 650,4,Good sound but but for long term this speaker battery was very bad after using 2 year
boAt Stone 650,Almaaz Islam,Battery,4,I have been using it for 2 years now and the speakers are not working properly after 2yrs of not so regular use. Sound quality was good battery was good aswell but should have lasted more for 2k
boAt Stone 650,Amazon Customer,Very good product,4,"Mm nice product, met the expectation."
boAt Stone 650,Shantanu Gaikwad,Best,4,Build quality is best but was expecting for more sound quality
boAt Stone 650,Yatin,Low Battery,4,"Its all good but the battery backup is while low , like 3-4 hours max ."
boAt Stone 650,Anil D.,Wonderful,4,Nice products bass kamal ka
boAt Stone 650,BUNNY,Go for it,4,"Designer brings the bass heavy from the device,thia is second time i am purchasing this product."
boAt Stone 650,Akshay Lawangare,It works great for small rooms !,4,"It works great for small rooms, the sound output is not that great it is just normal if you are someone who likes to hear at high volume pls go for JBL. Pros: Compact, lightweight, nice design Cons : 1. We have to manually OFF it 2. Not having a type C port."
boAt Stone 650,Murali Manohar,Evrything is good except bluetooth connectivity.,4,Nice speaker for 2k only issue is blutooth connectivity. Mobile literally had to be side of the speaker. Little far away breaks the out out of music.
boAt Stone 650,Good product,Good product,4,Good quality
boAt Stone 650,Dip,Overall good,4,"Immersive base ....base feel good ...build quality also good ...but when base increase , vocal are reduce"
boAt Stone 650,Aritro Goswami,"Extremely recomend it, best sound in this price ;)",4,"So After My full testing of Boat Stine 650, I can conclude that:- i)The sound quality I will give perfectly 5 star. As per the price and the power wich is 10W, I will extremely recommend it.... the sound does not crack even when it's in full volume which is the best part....talking about the bass, it's best in class also the waterproof rating ( ip X5) makes the package complete. ii) talking about the build quality, It is very good, rubber pads are used for grips, the button feels premium according to this price....but there is one complain that they should have used usb type C instead of a regular USB port....it takes around 5 hours to completely charge (from 0-100%). iii) Talking about the portability and Bluetooth, here I have reduced a single star, as the bluetooth range is not so good as compared to other boat products, I use eardope 121v2 and Rockerz 510, there bluetooth range is more that this speaker, and as it is 10W, it feels bulky wich makes it feel more premium also.....Overall it is a very good and best product in this price range. Yiu can also consider other boat speakers as well if you have a high or low budget, the sound quality is very good.. iv) The Delivery of the speaker was exactly and on perfect time mentioned by Amazon when I ordered. v) The packaging was also good, a plastic packet is used outside where it is mentioned that the packaging should not be opened or sealed with tape. Inside there was a cardboard box and inside that the original box of the speaker was there... Hence the product is awesome."
boAt Stone 650,Ajay singh,Sound quality,4,The media could not be loaded. Bass is so cool
boAt Stone 650,Sandeep,Nice Product,4,Good and very clear sound.
boAt Stone 650,Satyavathi,Pitch sonud.,4,I can hear a pitch sound but it is not loud. It can be only heard when you are 10cm from your ear. Overall Nice but the highs and mids are mixed.
boAt Stone 650,Atitul Rahman,Good,4,Very good
boAt Stone 650,Deepika,Good,4,Speaker is good but customised Micro SD is not support for customized
boAt Stone 650,Bhuvanesh S,One year usage review of BS 650,4,The speaker was amazing. I'm using this speaker still now. The sound quality is too good. Bass is unstoppable but battery life from beginning it's poor. In full sound speaker playing 3-3.5 hrs non stop. In half of sound I've got 7hrs playback time. I was purchased this for 1.5k in an offer time. Now it's 2k. I recommend to buy this on any festival time to get less price. It's really worth for money. But surrounding 5 meters you'll get bass feeling. Above 5 can get only high sound only. Sound quality is very good.

boAt Stone 650,Piyush Pandey,Product review,4,Very nice product at this price and bass of this speaker is very powerful.
boAt Stone 650,Binu s saraswathy,Overall good experience,4,I bought the same product from Amazon twice. The first one which I bought almost an year ago stopped charging and hence stopped working a few days back. So I can say it lasts for an year without much complaints. This product is good and is better for a single room. We can connect laptop and phone through bluetooth and is easy to connect. We get an aux cable and a charging cable in this box. I personally prefer the black colour. And it is easily portable.
boAt Stone 650,Nithiyan,great sound,4,sound is clear
boAt Stone 650,Kavitha,1 issue but Goood Speaker,4,The media could not be loaded. This is purely Value for money good Bass. Great Clarity. Small Issue: My phone (M53 5G) has an issue In connectivity Like Very low sound and no functiong of Volume up down keys but speaker is connected.But when I connected with my Samsung M20 and My TV it worked Excellent good Bass At 1500
boAt Stone 650,kamini gangurde,Value for money,4,Good product and better quality output for the price
boAt Stone 650,Bhima Shanker Rai,All the best but battery is,4,Battery
boAt Stone 650,Screcko,compact at a cost,4,design is very nice. functioning of the device is good and fluent. easy to use and connectivity is properly smooth. very much portable with the size it came. sound quality is decent. bass is uneven but slightly regular because the drivers at this price aren't that elegant and the term is used too frequent without any customs. the loudness though is very loud for a speaker of this size. it is appreciated for the effort that it had been put into. sound quality is crisp and clear although i preferred to use the volume at mids to get the full clarity of the music and it just works without any flaws. i loved the device. its good. indeed for minor parties and outdoor chills for solo or for a group it is very perfect. nice touch boAt!
boAt Stone 650,Rahul Kumar,Quality,4,Best product
boAt Stone 650,Indronil Halder,Review of boat stone 650,4,About the product: 1. Build quality- product is sturdy and quite hefty too. It has steel mesh all around the body. Overall rugged build I think it can handle a few drops though I have not tested it. All buttons are on one side. Quality of buttons is decent. 2. Connectivity- Connection through bluetooth is very quick. Also connects through aux cable by default when plugged in. No complaints here. 3. Sound - The main thing here. Sound is decent and quite bass heavy. On loudest volume speaker is reasonably loud enough for a living room along with two adjoining rooms if doors are open. 4. Battery life- Okayish not the best. Takes around 3 hrs to fully charge. Overall I deducted one star for average battery life. It is a decent purchase for Rs. 1500. Boat is providing good products for reasonable price.
boAt Stone 650,Dipak,Nice music and speech sound.,4,Nice sound quality but charging cable provided with this speaker does not support for this speaker. Size of the charging cable is larger than slot provided.
boAt Stone 650,Parag Mandal,It's good with Bluetooth but Boom with aux,4,"i got it today, I tested the sound, with Bluetooth connection the sound quality is good, bass is good, but the real boom beast sound is when you connect it with aux cable, massive bass, high sound, and overall product is good build quality is also good. At this price point 1500rs definately recommended ,2000rs is expensive then go for other options"
boAt Stone 650,Aparna,It is not complete 7hr,4,"Battery is not 7hrs it goes down in 2hr or even 1hr when in maximum volume otherwise sound quality,base, is very good"
boAt Stone 650,Harsha,Good,4,Excellent sound when I purchased it. But after 1 year of usage the sound was not clear and poor performance after that warranty period.
boAt Stone 650,Bijay Kumar Saw,Price,4,Price is too much high. I bought 1400 rupees but you need to provide within 800 rupees. 800 rupee is sufficient for this product.
boAt Stone 650,manoj bagrecha,Could be better in base,4,"Base is very lacking, otherwise good value for money. Sound is alright."
boAt Stone 650,BABAI,Boat stone 650,4,Superb
boAt Stone 650,Prof MG chandrakanth,"Speaker is excellent, but is difficult to locate switches, there is no handle for carrying",4,"What I liked: The boAt stone 650 Blue tooth speaker quickly connected to my PC. I can listen to classical music for long hours sitting away from the PC which means a great relief for me, especially with neck pain.i can sit with ease or sleep in comfortable posture listening to music and philosophic lectures at ease. Also another point is the boAt stone speaker worked even upto 25 feet away from the PC which is a great benefit for me. The speaker also has good volume and clarity. What I did not like: It is very difficult to locate and identify the on/off, increase/decrease volume, pause switches as well as difficult to locate the charging points because the colour of the speaker is blue or red or black and the color of switches is also the same. Please change the color of switches. What I did not like: The boAt stone 650 speaker needs to at least have a handle since it is a bit heavy. So please give a small handle."
boAt Stone 650,Saurabh Mishra,Battry,4,Battery back is not good
boAt Stone 650,Ranjan,Good,4,Sound quality good. Battery life time is average
boAt Stone 650,Nishith Jain,Type C is missing..,4,This is a honest review. Everything is good about this speaker. From connectivity to sound quality everything is excellent. I think base could be good but it is acceptable at this price range. The thing which snatches a star from this speaker is the charging port which is micro usb. My all devices and earphones have type C port which is very convenient to use. The lack of type C port at this price range is not acceptable by me.
boAt Stone 650,Hrituraj Sinha,It's battery backup is not good if you are going to play in full volume,4,"I didn't like it's battery backup , it's very low considering its price in my opinion."
boAt Stone 650,Gossipius,boAt Stone 650 10W Bluetooth Speaker,4,I am using this speaker more than 10 days. happy with the quality and sound is also good. worth of money.
boAt Stone 650,Rahil saifi,Battery problem hori hai,4,Maine ye speaker 4 May 2022 me kharida hai or battery me dikkat hori h pehle din hi battery 90% se uper charge hi nahi ho rahi hai. Aur dusra issue ye h ki agr battery ka level 60% ya kuch bhi hai or wo thodi si down hui maankr chali 40% ho gyi fir wo dubara 60% show krega speaker jb charging pr laga raha hu tou red light band nahi ho rahi hai yrrr
boAt Stone 650,saurabh,product is awesome as bass and sound quality are great but seller delivered me repackaged product.,4,the product delivered to me was repackaged with tape as original circular tape was damaged. i dont know if it was used. there is also minor cut on corner of connectivity socket hole as you can see in image. it took 8 days to deliver the product that never happened with amazon in my past experience. otherwise sound quality is awesome. bass is loud and punchy i really like it. you can see the effort of boat company in these speakers as its sound quality and bass balance remains same from low volume to maximum. Cons.- every time you turn on the speaker it plays only sd card/aux if they are inserted no matter you switch off while using bluetooth mode.you have to press power button once when it says 'you are now plug into nirwana' otherwise it will play your sd card at very high volume. volume level become high when you power on the speaker no matter on what level you turned off.
boAt Stone 650,Pri S,"Not so loud, but quality sound",4,"If you have a noisy cooler like i do, then you may find it challenging to hear the sound in movie dialogues. Otherwise for music it's a party for one even with the cooler on. I really like the maroon colour and the quality of the product is good too, doesn't look lightweight and cheap. The USB charger cable is of very poor quality that comes along with it. I am not using that one at all."
boAt Stone 650,Keval,Amazing experience,4,Overall everything is good and tidy but it would be more amazing if type c port was there in place of micro usb. Otherwise sound quality is good...
boAt Stone 650,harsha punjabi,"Bluetooth speaker, a must buy product",4,"Got the delivery today , happy to find that the sound quality is good enough. All of them at home loved it. Quite good and this range. Thank you Amazon"
boAt Stone 650,Suman Kumari,"Great bluetooth speaker - deep bass, clear sound, less bluetooth range",4,"I am really satisfied with the product. The stone 650 is a great companion while travel. However the bluetooth range is on the lower side but i am okk with it as I don't need to roam around with speaker connected. Rather I prefer to keep the speakers by my side to feel the music. It's that much portable. Talking about the weight, yes, it's on the higher side as compared to other speakers. And that's the reason it remains stable even at full sound with deep bass other wise the speaker would have thumping on the table with the bass. For me it's a great buy. It would have been better if the bluetooth range is high. But I didn't reduced anybstat for that since it's a portable speaker and I prefer to keep by my side. No issue with connectivity. It's easily gets connected. Got it for 1499 with 150 more on card discount. So a perfect product at 1349. But even at 1999 I would say it's a great buy."
boAt Stone 650,Sujoy Patra.,Awesome sounds quality.,4,Awesome sounds quality. And looks also good. And most of the importance think is this device bass quality omg it's so good.

boAt Stone 650,Uday,Its kind of ok,4,Good great pick go for it But if you want long better battery and and more sound go for boat party storm speaker its battery is about 4-5 hour Its not for big rooms and small party better to use it as dancing alone you know we indians can do juggad so we can use it as party And build quality is super rubber buttons charging pot and aux go for it if it is your first speaker igot it in 999 rupees

boAt Stone 650,Sajeer fozzy,Nice,4,Nice device. But don't expect for bass. Because it's boat device. Any previous experienced people can understand about it.
boAt Stone 650,Prakash,Bass super but soundvis low,4,Bass quality is best
boAt Stone 650,Sandesh,A good buy at this price,4,Writing this review after 3+ months... it's working good and the battery backup is satisfactory around 2+ day (playback+standby time). Watched 3 movies back to back and still some battery left though the sound quality is not comparable to high end speakers like JBL or Bose but at this price it's worth a buy. Also the most important thing the sound doesn't burst at high volume for an average 256kbps sound file. The volume level is not too high but satisfactory.
boAt Stone 650,Deep,Good speaker.,4,Good speaker with balanced bass and treble. The only con is tye battery backup.
boAt Stone 650,Just a middle class man,Review after Heavy usage,4,"The media could not be loaded. I have been using this for last 10-11 months and for the first 6-7 months the product worked superb, but after that it's volume started to go in dumps ,then sound started disorting after that the right side speaker stopped working . I kinda m an elctrical student and tried to solve the issue but when i looked into it the right speaker reached its limit So all n all the speakers used in this are above average quality but don't last more than 7-8 months , the battery is absolutely superb I have yet to face any issues regarding that , the bass WAS good but it droped as months passed by. So yeah is it worth to buy this? - Yes , it can handle very tough usage and is durable enough (at least for 7-8 months)"
boAt Stone 650,Akshat Aggarwal,Loud,4,"I felt that the sound clarity could be improved a little bit. It's more suited for music with a lot of bass. You might not get the best experience of listening to calm music on this. It's definitely loud. Waterproof. I faced no issues with the connectivity. Battery lasts good enough. So all in all, it justifies the price tag perfectly. Apt for outdoor usage as well as in house."
boAt Stone 650,Godson Arun Kumar,Excellent product but got with minor defect,4,Excellent sound amplitude and bass from the stone 650 and easy controls. Might not be for the keen audiophile but those preferring good sound decibels and bass would be satisfied. Another point to note was that I received a marginally defective product with the paint slightly eroded on two areas of the metal grille. I didn't request for a replacement considering the added time and people contact to return and replace. Those ordering might need to keep this defect noted.
boAt Stone 650,Aditya,Great product in mid range category,4,This is my 1st bluetooth speaker bought in Oct'20. Almost 8 months later also this is working good. Good and loud enough sound for a room 15ft x 15ft for movie or small party in your room and in this budget (bought at rs 1499). 3-4hrs reqd for full charging and playtime almost 6hrs at 75% volume (charger adapter/ cable not provided- micro USB port is there which many mobile phones have). A bit heavy if you are travelling light. Bluetooth connectivity is fine (sometimes takes half a min to search and connect with with my paired laptop).
boAt Stone 650,aman,sound quality,4,"best performance in base, sound quality and battery backup best speaker in this price range"

boAt Stone 650,rohatash c.,Best in price,4,"Pros:- Sound quality, build, bettry backup all are good. In volume better than JBL as I have Jbl flip 3. Cons:- Lack the base in low sound unlike JBL you can not feel the base in low volume. While on call you dont have volume control, by default it plays at full volume and you can not lower the volume from you device nor from speaker, it makes it unusefull for calling."
boAt Stone 650,Gupta,Value for price,4,Good sound quality. Good build quality. Battery backup is good. Value for money
boAt Stone 650,uwu,worth the money,4,The media could not be loaded. i got this for someone else so i cant write a review based upon a long term of usage. also im not a techie so my review isnt gonna help you with the details lol but i can tell you that in this price it is definitely worth it. only downside is that it isnt as loud as i expected it to be. the bass is louder than the volume but thats not as annoying as i at first thought it to be. side note: in the video the volume wasnt at max.
boAt Stone 650,Shaurya,At 1500Rs. Its a good option!,4,"Bought this in 1500Rs. Review Considering Budget of 2000 max. Sound- 4/5. Sound quality is decent but dont bother to compare with Sony or JBL. JBL flip 3 has better sound. But Flip 3 is thrice its price. . There is little difference in sound quality when connected with mobile or a laptop. Laptop gives better sound quality. Overall decent and balanced sound quality. Battery- 4/5. Battery depends on the speaker's volume. At 50% volume you can expect 10-12hrs and at 80% upto 7hrs, which is decent. Battery backup is better than portronics speakers and somewhat similar to jbl flip 3. Connectivity- Bluetooth works fine with Mobile and laptop. Didn't faced any disconnection. Weight- It is heavy and big. But still portable. Considering a 2k budget its a good option."
boAt Stone 650,Prashant Mani,Boat best quality speaker,4,"It is having good sound and bass is also good, if you are using vlc it will boost your device with loudest sound"
boAt Stone 650,K Selvam,Good product but volume controls not working.,4,Today I got the speaker. Everything as mentioned in the reviews including superb sound are found in the product except the voume control buttons. Neither the + sound volume button nor the - button works. It is stand still. I can not increase the sound nor decrease. This the problem I found immediately after receiving the product. I requested Amazon for replacement. The courier person called me to return the item stating that the replacement will be made later. Is it so in Amazon replacement policy? I informed the courier person to provide new one and take back the problematic Boat stone 650. Can any one help me in this regards.
boAt Stone 650,Bhatt Shyam,great deal,4,its very great product. bass is very good but i feels its sound is a bit low. portability is very good. battery back up is not as expected. but over all value for money product.
boAt Stone 650,Gokul R Nair,Overall its great but a bit lack of loudness,4,"Its so cool for those who looking for a budget speaker with nice bass. I would suggest to go for it. Quality is great, Bass is Good and what lacks is the loudness. For one room it fits fine but for large rooms or hall you will find a laack of loudness.. and Battery backup is also good. Go for it guyss..."
boAt Stone 650,Chandra,Good sound and good build quality,4,"Liked the sound compared to other 10 watt speakers at lower price, so worth the price. One issue which is annoying is - it is not able to pair with Amazon echo devices I tried with. Same echo devices have been able to connect with all other Bluetooth speakers I have used."

The only bad things is its heavy 500g approx, and its battery backup , when u use it at full volume it give 3-4 hr at full charge ,5-7 at low volume or may be more , otherwise its best sound speker overall, I purchased it for1500 on sale"

boAt Stone 650,Yash W.,Similar sound quality to boat rugby but little more features and more price.,4,I had a boat rugby than speaker failed and I instanly bought this....If you only care about sound quality then go with rugby it's cheaper and offers same sound quality.. But I personly like it's looks and it has some extra features.. Like you can insert memory card and can skip tracks rugby dosen't have than and also rugby have BT4.0 so you can't check battery on phone but you can check 650's battery percent... I would say sound quality is slighty better vocals are bit clear but same base and can't notice a diff

In moving second room, and change music also worked. Not any objection in bluetooth connectivity. Pros. Bluetooth connectivity is very good. Sound quality is mind blowing. Bass is also good Memory card slot and aux cable slot ( including aux cable in box) Battery backup is very good. After 2 hour continues playing its down only 10%. Approx 6 hour total backup. Cons. Little heavy When battery goes below 30% its gives notification every 1 minute says battery low its very irritating. Please update this firmware."
boAt Stone 650,Mulagapaka Suresh,Good but not good at charging,4,"Sound and connectivity are very nice, however, most important, the charging part is not that good. The speaker has little over weight, I was just thinking the weight is due to the charging equipment to accommodate long time backup, but I literally disappointed."
boAt Stone 650,Mukesh Kumar Gupta,Best,4,The media could not be loaded.
boAt Stone 650,moin,It won't shut up,4,"I bought a speaker to listen to music but it wont shut up. The speaker is literally talking to me non stop. There are multiple audio confirmations programmed into the speaker. If you connect it, if you disconnect it and even when the battery is low."
boAt Stone 650,Pradeep,Strong and powerful,4,"I have been a fan of Bluetooth speakers so this was my first. But after using it for more than a month, here is my review. Let's jump to pros and cons Pros: 1. As advertised, it's strong and rugged. No doubt about that 2. Battery life is long and auto shut off feature is a saver 3. I prefer medium intensity of sound and it perfectly delivers it 4. Connectivity is fast and have decent range Cons: 1. If you wamt to use via aux cable and there is no holder for it. You have to carry it seperately Overall: For this price, it's decent. Before buying do checkout boat other speakers."
boAt Stone 650,brahmas_bull,VFM PRODUCT BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT. READ ON!,3,"The media could not be loaded. Whats in the box: Speaker - 1N Short Usb Charging Cable Leaflets &amp; Warranty card Switching On &amp; Off: It's the worst turn down for me, this thing speaks alot. You have plugged into nirvana, adios amigo, bluetooth connection successful, battery low, disconnected. It's the only feature that I hate about it. A basic beep &amp; a long beep while turning it off would have sufficed. Sound Quality: A good little sounding speaker but lacks in loudness &amp; compensates for that in terms of bass! Its good to listen to in a small room around a 100 to 150 sq.ft. room. Loudness is not there at all for a 10W speaker that can be a turn down for some. I had jbl flip 2 before this &amp; it sounded really good &amp; was also loud enough to fill a room of size about 200 to 250 sq.ft. with full of people. Jbl flip 2 costed me around Rs5500 whereas this one costed me about Rs1900. Lower than half of what jbl costed me. Bluetooth Connectivity: Has been good enough to take it in bathroom while my phone is in the room charging. Lacks instant connection or pairing with your phone as soon as you turn it on. Sometimes keeps disconnecting for a second or two when it's connected to my laptop, not sure why it happens. Battery: Compared to jbl flip 2 this one is a beast in battery department. I originally gifted this one to my sister but just before lockdown my flip 2 stopped working &amp; being used to listening to songs from the minute I wake up &amp; during the day when I am free I had to ask my sister to give it to me until lockdown ends. I used this speaker extensively during lockdown guys, sometimes even for 8 to 12 hours straight watching movie, listening to songs &amp; it's battery didn't die on me before 2 days of usage even then. Let's put it in terms of jbl flip, with volume about 80% I had to plug it in just after 3 to 4 hours. And it was a headache. What I like? Battery Life - Lasts for 2 days with 80% to 85% volume &amp; 8 hours of usage each day. Waterproof Dedicated buttons for play/pause, next &amp; previous command. Warranty &amp; after sales service is good, my earphones had stopped working &amp; upon sending it to mumbai I received a refurbished replacement in few days. What i don't like? Bluetooth connectivity has issues while playing songs from laptop, even if I put it next to or on the laptop itself. Lacks instant pairing which is a letdown for me, as I have to scroll through device everytime to connect. Voice distorts sometimes even at 60% to 70% volume &amp; I don't know why. The blinking led on the front is distracting. When it has battery low it keeps speaking every 30 seconds &amp; also increases volume on its own. So all of a sudden it just pumps out voice loudly after the battery low voice. All the voice greetings are a big down turn for me, beep would have better suited. I have attached a few pics &amp; a video that will give you the better idea. If you like it don't forget to upvote it so fellow buyers can make a decision. Disclaimer: I am no audiophile. The review is based on my personal experience with this product &amp; other products!"

boAt Stone 650,Ravi Hiremath,This is a Bluetooth speaker with very good sound quality but one major disappointment,3,"I will try to summarise my opinion in just a few lines. First of all I will focus upon its positive aspects and at the end will mention about negative points as well. Considering all the reviews given to it by the people I thought it will be the best option for me in my budget range. After I purchased it and it was deliver to me I was not at all disappointed with its sound quality and durability, it was absolutely up to the point portable durable and superior sound quality perfect for average sized room. Speaking about its battery life it's good and can say average up to four and half, upto 5 hours, overall if you want a portable bluetooth speaker full of power you can go for this one with ultimate sound quality no distortion at the high volume also, more than that the easy to operate buttons and controls and their rubberized grip is good. The facility of SD card slot is also a good point here to listen to any saved music. Coming to its cons one major drawback that I faced with this speaker was its volume, my point is I'm listening to a song at volume level 2 for some time, then I turn off the speaker after sometime when I turn it on the volume should be at level to itself however unfortunately in this speaker the volume again kicks up to the highest point creating lot of problems and disturbance when the surrounding is very much silent and when I expect the speaker to just stay at the volume before I turned it off that was the major problem which I faced and returned the product. Further if FM radio option would have been provided it would have been good. Overall this is my honest review and now it's your decision to purchase it or not. I'm taking off 2 stars for the volume problem which I faced which was very much disappointing."
boAt Stone 650,Aakash Singh Thakur,Overall battry power is low,3,"Good bass, high sound quality but one thing disappoint you that is low battery power."
boAt Stone 650,One problematic thing about it is its battery. Not a very long lasting battery im afraid to say.,Battery life,3,"Battery life is poor, needs to be charged more often tham required !!"
boAt Stone 650,Chetan,Battery backup issue,3,"Sound quality was good, but battery backup showing on box is upto 7hrs after using from very first day I observed battery issue. If I use the speaker 2hrs then it showing battery low."
boAt Stone 650,Hema lakshmi,Average,3,"Overall okay product only, the volume is not so loud, once full charged it works fine for 3 to 3 and half hours"
boAt Stone 650,amarkant,Not good in terms of battery backup.,3,"The media could not be loaded. I am writing this review after using this product for approx 1.5 year. Currently, I am getting at most 3 hours of battery backup. It's iron body gets corrosion just after 5 months. I added pictures and videos of how it looks now. It's looks very bad now. Not recommended. It will be good in between 1400-1500. The sound quality is good. On full volume battery backup will be only 2 hrs max after charging it for 3 to 4 hrs. It will take 4 hrs to full charge which will last to only 3-4 hrs. Not good in terms of battery backup."

boAt Stone 650,Abhishek kumar,Does the work but don't get your hopes too high.,3,"The media could not be loaded. I didn't feel like writing a review but I had to for those who wanna buy this... Pros:- 1) Build quality and design is superb 2) Feels premium when compared to other low end speakers and earlier versions 3) Bass is good enough for a 10 watt speaker 4) You get both bluetooth and aux cable connectivity Cons:- 1) Sound quality is not what I expected. It was very low though I am saved thanks to my viper4android fx which really increased it for like 30 percent. 2) Sound distorts when I go above 85-90 percent. 3) It's heavy AF. 4) I guess it was prolly made for dwarfs cuz I still don't know why they provided like a .5 meter aux and charging cable. Edit - after 3 months of usage the biggest drawback is the talking notifications and when you're close to or less than 20 percent battery then this thing will make your ears bleed and I'm not kidding. It's gonna say 'oops, battery low' every minute and keeps on going until the battery dies completely."
boAt Stone 650,RUPAM DAS,Great product for the price but the audio notifications are irritating.,3,"Like: 1. Portable. It's not that heavy or bulky. 2. Good battery life. At medium volumes it lasted at least 6-7 hours for each full charge. 3. Speakers on opposite sides that gives equal sound on both side. Good to listen when people are sitting around a table. 4. Bass volume/feel is really good and you can hear low notes that aren't audible on laptop/phone speakers normally. Dislike: 1. (Major) The audio notifications do not follow the volume set by you. Instead they hike the volume to 66% and play the notifications and then keep the volume at 66%. 66% volume can be quite disturbing if you were relaxing and listening to music at 15-20% volume. Notifications like 'Battery low' and 'Oops there you are'. 2. Some times the Bluetooth connection keeps losing and reconnecting frequently, despite very nearby placement of source and the speaker. 3. The audio notifications are annoying in my personal experienced. Short messages like 'Power on', 'Connected', 'Disconnected' would have been sufficient. Even combination of multiple beeps would have been good enough. The current audio notifications are mildly irritating after a point. 4. The top surface is also having perforations like the sides that have the speakers. So, this gives rise to dust accumulation in the holes on the top. Not a smart design though it may look better with a continuous surface all around."
boAt Stone 650,Sumesh J.,useable only for indoor not good for outdoor,3,"when you play inside home its good to use,but for outside its a low volume speaker. Other speakers gives good large volume sound. Some speaker is available at this range with better sound. Its good shape and tough outer thats why i bought it but not that much happy as i can not return it."
boAt Stone 650,Rakibul,Battery backup,3,Everything is totally perfect only battery problem just 30-40 minutes and battery low. But sound bass is good

So overall great buy.

boAt Stone 650,AKSHAJ,Battery back up is not so appreciable. U WILL GET the promised playback time.,3,"Sound quality. Durability and bass everything is perfect. But what bothered me was only the battery back up. Even though they have mentioned 6 hrs of battery back up.. u will get more than 6 hrs of battery back up,but u will feel like the battery back up needs to be more.. such a pleasure it is listening to it. I hope the company increase the battery back up to 10 hrs or more. The next thing which annoys me is that when the battery reaches 40% it starts telling u battery low very frequently which is very much disturbing while watching a movie or a song. Main drawback. !!! Battery less than 40% means u can't enjoy anything beyond. It keeps on telling u battery low every 10 second or so"
boAt Stone 650,Rajan,Low Volume Speaker,3,"You can use it only in two rooms, not for a big hall but if the hall is empty then it seems like good volume. Low volume I am using bounce by proteomics 5w and its 10 w speakers. Even bounce 5w speaker produce more volume than 10 a boat stone 650. The bass is ok u can find more bass in the 5w speaker by the bounce. Talk about open area not much volume here it's losing. Some timed you to realize that 5W speakers have more volume or sound than boat 650. Overall not up to the mark. A heavyweight likes a name stone."
boAt Stone 650,vignesh,45 ok. Expectations not met,3,"Ok product. Try for some other. Sound quality is ok for some songs. Not so clear sound. Updated on 25-Jul-2023: Battery is not good, giving playback for less than 1 hour. Not satisfied with what they mention (7 hours)."
boAt Stone 650,DISHO VARGHESE,Not a recommendation review on 23 aug 2021 >buy only through AMAZON,3,"The media could not be loaded. Not so big enough to make a big sound, comparing to my I ball music base it lags behind in sound output and quality, for 10 W speaker it needs to improve in sound , design is great and its our Indian brand I wish all the success , voice assistance is very good and appreciate the fast delivery by amazon and in shops this speaker is more expensive buy only on amazon"
boAt Stone 650,Placeholder,Serves the purpose. The size of the device and the voulme coming from it does not match,3,"Got this speaker on an offer. Worth 1.1k But, the maximum volume of the speaker is pretty disappointing. The bulk of the device and the voume output just does not match up. The rest is fine. Not gonna complain over a speaker that costs just over 1k"
boAt Stone 650,Aman Ashok Sawarkar,Low Sound,3,Sound quality is ok but it's not loud
boAt Stone 650,Amazon Customer,Sound is so low,3,Honestly; I have 2 mobile On android the speaker sound is low though my mobile sound is at full mode. On Apple the speaker sound is up to the mark. It's not like the woofer type but for people like who love slow music with medium volume it's best
boAt Stone 650,Sourav Dasgupta,Mic is present but doesnt work. Sound quality is OK,3,The sound quality is fair for the price. Not great. Just fair. The biggest let down for me was the mic. I use it for music as well as for attending office meetings. The otherside always complained that my voice is very low and seems to be coming from far. Expected more.

boAt Stone 650,Gaurav Teotia,It is just ok. Not more than that.,3,"Initially when I bought this speaker the loudness of speaker was good but after using it 2-3 months, now it's sound reduced atleast by 30%. Before this I purchased boat stone 170 of 5w which was cheaper than this one and also has a very robust sound than this. But overall it is ok."
boAt Stone 650,Bhavna Batham,Ok,3,Brand says 7 hour playback.. it's not true... it's only play 3 hour.. in full charge . and not feel like 10 watt.. it's feel like 5 watt small speaker. If return would be possible ...I will return this.
boAt Stone 650,SAJ,Don't expect sound quality. Cheap and portable,3,This so cheap that you should not expect sound quality. But yes Bluetooth connectivity is ok and it's easy for carrying. So if you are looking for some more sound at place you go. You can go for it. And if you are looking for having a good crystal clear song... Never go for this dump product.
boAt Stone 650,sanat,rich sound...poor battery,3,"Cant really compalin about sound quality ..well to do in this price range .. but battery life is aweful... not 6-7 hrs as committed ....rather playback time is just 2-3 hrs (max) in avg volume .. Moreover, It just goes on giving battery low warnings continously as the battery reaches 30 percent,thus interrupting the play back and to add to the misery the device collapses with 20 percent charge left with it . its good just as a plug and play device ..not as a go-anywhere wireless speaker. bluetooth connectivity range is about 20 m (not exact) The design is undoubtedly robust and sturdy but the colouring of the metal can get removed with scratches .It has got no straps or pouch for travel. Major concern -Poor Battery life (could further worsen with aeging of the device )"
boAt Stone 650,Saravanan Selvavinayagam,Average sound quality,3,"In terms of music and songs, Bass and Volume are Good. Clarity in voice is below average as compared to JBL, Since I mainly used to listen to podcasts, vlogs and sort of commentary I felt it's not upto the mark. Connectivity has disturbances but not too often and range is fine within a room limits."
boAt Stone 650,Nitin,Good sound with poor Bluetooth connectivity,3,"This speaker is good only if you keep paired device in the same room otherwise it drops sound even if paired device is moved to another room. Further, it cannot be used as a Phone Speaker as there is no option to control volume while on call once connected to the phone same is the case when connected to the laptop."
boAt Stone 650,Placeholder,Go with precaution.,3,"Sound review:- Mid is good for slow &amp; relaxed song. But baas isn't good as expected from others review, I'm going to return this product. Sound quality isn't satisfied for me."
boAt Stone 650,Amazon Customer,Trust your EAR not Eyes,3,"It's been 2 days I am using this product below are the observation 1. While listening to songs you can notice better voice quality but instrument sounds not very impressive. You will feel like old age speaker diaphragm sounds when it comes to loud beats. 2. Aux cable is short, so not much use. 3 . Bluetooth is fine, battery backup 5 hrs. 4. When battery is near to draining out , they have some default alert voice which is very irritating. Though price is cheap but will recommend go for other brands like Sony or JBL, these things are one time purchase so better trust your ear n mind not eyes. Boat can't be BOSE :)"
boAt Stone 650,SB,Moderate quality sound with many flaws,3,"* Moderate quality sound, very low wothout app. * Bluetooth connectivity not good for me, massively catches interference. * Battery life is good, but don't show actual charge percentage. Needs firmware update. * Starts shouting 'oops battery low' well before shutdown and pushes volume level low. It's very annoying, If I am not bothered about low battery then why shoul Boat be bothered and tell me it's low batt every 20secs??? Please fix this in an update."
boAt Stone 650,TARUN JANA,Avarage,3,"The media could not be loaded. Product is avarage. Sound quality is not so good. One major issues is when Memory card was inserted, if you try to remove it is difficult. Memory card can not remove easily."
boAt Stone 650,Sharafat Mattewale,Amazing,3,Best products
boAt Stone 650,Joyroy,Not good Product quality and bild,3,"After 4 months use product colour faded and after 30 % battery automatically sound volume decrease and battery down gide, it's a really irritating"
boAt Stone 650,Gaurav Todankar,Design Erodes & Poor connectivity,3,"The media could not be loaded. Design gets erroded in weeks. Especially the peaks as shown in the video. The speaker looks old just in 2 weeks. Bluetooth connectivity is not up to the mark Requires line of sight for seamless connection. Battery connection is fine, Sound quality is good."
boAt Stone 650,Tush M,Boat is awesome but it had some drowbacks,3,I have been using this speaker for 3 months. It has awesome bass and sound quality. Little disappointed with battery. But it's okay for me to buy low budget speaker with awesome quality. 12 Aug - EDIT: I am editing this review. on 12 Aug I was listening songs using AUX mode and I turn it off and turn it ON again and press one more time power button to change in bluetooth mode. But It stuck. After that I can only play songs using AUX cable not bluetooth mode. I have complaint about it. Wait for reply. Will update the reply here.
boAt Stone 650,ANSHUL AGRAWAL,Okay Okay speaker,3,Speaker is good but many other speakers are there in the market for the same price with better sound quality. Its voice is good for small rooms only. Can go for other products I will suggest. And cannot take this device easily to other places bcz of size.
boAt Stone 650,Ritik,Returned in day 1.,3,"Ohhh! I watched every video about it, read every review and compared every price and in last ordered this in a hoe to be getting something good but it's just aweful experience in the end. There is vibration sound from speaker when in loud volume. Its just soo bad that you can clearly hear that something is wrong in there. I can ignore some distortion noice, but this just soo much bad. In the end, returning this item and hoping to get similar watt speaker with nice bass and sound."
boAt Stone 650,Hanif,All is good but battery life is OK,3,If you get the speaker in 1300 then go for it. The only issues is the battery sucks 2-3 hrs and apart from this there is no proper display of battery life it goes down directly to 30 from 60 . Charging battery led is red but it is only visible when you look closely
boAt Stone 650,Vikas Srivastava,Bluetooth lags & whistling sound from speaker,3,The Bluetooth lags with almost all devices and after using it for a month there is a constant whistling sound from the speaker when switched on
boAt Stone 650,Adil Hussain Chy.,A Bad Choice in Speakers,3,"Mono sound system but Bass is brilliant. Slight distortion at high levels of volume. Bluetooth is version 4.6. Please go for Boat Stone 352, A better option."
boAt Stone 650,Mithra D,Its not worth for the money,3,"The product build quality is real good. Its very solid. I have not done any drop test, still it looks very good at the build quality. The volume of the device is also BIG, Bluetooth connectivity is stable and power consumption is also awesome. The quality of the sound is not good at all, clarity is missing completely. A less quality bass is there, but its annoying with less quality."
boAt Stone 650,Hemant Prasad,Sound is loud bass good but beats are missing,3,Quality wise is its not good from outside body if you keep it on floor it will get scratch paint will comeout or if it fall down it will damage badly. Battery is good utill 80 % then direct it comes to 30 40 % All of sudden it goes down. Beats are missing rythem are missing. Onlh loudness
boAt Stone 650,Megha Kumari,Keys are not working,3,"The media could not be loaded. Keys are not working at all, and sound is not good enough Ek ajeeb si jhar jhar jesi awaz aa ri h"
boAt Stone 650,Debashish Sahoo,Does the Job @ 1200,3,"I got it at 1200. Pertaining to the price in which I purchased it, its 5/5. However the punch and the bass is missing. The loudness of the speaker (10W) is also not that great. However, overally it does the job for a gathering of 6-7 people in a room of 250 sq ft."
boAt Stone 650,Prateek nimbre,Portable boat speaker,3,Sound is good but it's battery drain quickly.
boAt Stone 650,sai sanjeev,Expected more from boAt,3,The base can be lot much improved. Expected more base for this 10W speaker. If you leave the speaker in dusty place. The dust particles get stuck in the wholes and wouldn't be retrievable. Other than Base and resistance to dust everything is cool like the sound quality and others
boAt Stone 650,Yashika,Economical but poor battery life,3,"The sound quality is good, and Bluetooth connectivity and portability are great too. The speakers very also very economical, however, the battery backup is a little poor."
boAt Stone 650,Ashish Soni,Sound ok,3,"Full charge it's good, but below 60% battery automatically volume gose down &amp; it's similar to mobile volume, it's better to lesson in mobile."
boAt Stone 650,kartik Nair,Review the resolution for the above problem before purchase,3,"I purchased Boat Stone 650 bluetooth speaker in October 2020 , was working perfectly till yesterday. From today , it's not powering ON and the white light on the device is lit and not turning off. Tried charging the device too , but still not powering on. I demand a resolution on the product cause / issue . Awaitng in anticipation."
boAt Stone 650,Satyam priyambad,Avg,3,Sound Quality is avg. Bass need to be improved. If you play MP3 then its output is ok but when you play the same with YouTube or any other platforms its output is somewhere avg.
boAt Stone 650,Bharat Singh,Sound cracks at higher volume. Poor customer service. Compact and solid build. Poor battery life.,3,"Okay! Negative first... The sound starts cracking at higher volume, get worse with heavy bass songs. Poor customer care team. Dropped them an e-mail, raised a complaint for replacement, but they say the amazon invoice that I had attached was invalid and denied replacing it. Positive. Also the product is a bit heavy and the battery back up isn't that good after 6 months of use. Positives.. the design is compact, body is metal. Bluetooth connectivity is good."
boAt Stone 650,GYANESHWARI,Charging and service centre,3,"For this order ,intially it's working good,but now it's not charging properly, I don't have service centre near by me,since its has warranty period of 1 year can u suggest me fot the same"
boAt Stone 650,Brian Moduthgam,Charging port delivered in damaged condition.,3,Charging port was erratically charging since the begining .. and due to lockdown i wasnt able to go to the service center. now ther service center is denying to replace it claiming that the port is damaged .. but it was delivered in the same condition.
boAt Stone 650,Kiran P.,Should be cheaper,3,"When connecting and disconnecting to Bluetooth or max volume, very annoying voice announces you are now powered onto nirvana! Or adios amigo! Extremely silly. Finish of speaker is low quality. Should have had a handle or grip for portability. Sound is loud."
boAt Stone 650,Sumeet Bansal,Inbuilt Voice prompt are irritating,3,"Overall it's a good product at this price range. Pros: Clear sound till 90% volume. Good bass, loud sound, high Bluetooth range, heavy build quality. Cons: Voice prompts on turn on, turn off, device pairing. It starts irritating after 1-2 days. Just a plain sound signal would be classy like JBL n SONY. If there are options to turn off these voice prompts, let me know."
boAt Stone 650,Sushanta banik,About sound,3,Sound is less according to a 10w speaker. The sound spread is not in all directions.
boAt Stone 650,Placeholder,Quality issues,3,I received my speaker today..It has stains in it..I can see that many ppl are facing this issue..please rectify it..
boAt Stone 650,Amazon Customer,Not a happy experience,3,Just opened the box &amp; the speaker has these marks on its surface as if its been used before!?!? Not a happy experience.
boAt Stone 650,Rahul Prasad,Sound quality is low,3,I like the product but the sound quality is poor earlier also I have use the same product but the sound quality difference is there please check the sound quality
boAt Stone 650,Jagjit singh,Use speaker receive,3,This was very poor service received from you. You have given me used speaker this time. I have received memory card inside the speaker. i will not accept this. Speaker voise was Good but i need fresh product. And memory card option is not working
boAt Stone 650,Raghvendra Kumar Rai,If weight is not an issue go for it.,3,I have been using it for more than 3-4 month. Pros 1)Cost 2)Rugged 3)10W Cons 1)Portability is an issue specially weight. 2)Bluetooth connection(Doesn't cause problem though but irritates sometime) on startup only. 3)You will have to manually increase volume to max every time you start it.(Volume level always resets to default level on start)
boAt Stone 650,Shiv Arora,Complexity is there in returning the order,3,"Product is good but I dont want this so I want to return this not replace this , kindly help"
boAt Stone 650,Indrajit Debnath,My device not working,3,The media could not be loaded. My power button not working ...it still blue light showing .. when I connect my auxiliary cable into the port..but now it's showing that it's connect with aux in mode and buttons doesn't working .. it's still blue LED light from last night not working boat stone 650
boAt Stone 650,Biswajit Sinha,Sound and connectivity could be better. Boat please solve this issue.,3,"The media could not be loaded. Bought just about 3 days ago, *** Bluetooth connectivity could be better. Once you connected to this boat speaker afterwhile again if you connect to other device then it don't detect boat speaker again. *** Bass is good loudness would be better."
boAt Stone 650,Ghanshyam Rathod,Not much happy !! Worst battery - no refund,3,Just bought 2 days ago My kids online classes going for 4hrs. I see within 2 hrs its going from 90% to 10% and even at 10% it shutdown itself. I would rather choose smaller JBL go2 rather this. We need quality over big speakers.
boAt Stone 650,Biplab pal,Sound quality is good but loudness is bad (week),3,The media could not be loaded. Loudness week but sound quality is good. Battery back up not very good but average. I think bass is so high. In100% volume little direction I found. So review is 3/5
boAt Stone 650,Shijo s m,Veery bad packing and product,3,"Products are just ok, but I think this is not new product because product are fully dust and scratches, painting are totally damaged, product is not look like new product. Many more products are purchased all products are good but first time this product are very bad Amazon products."
boAt Stone 650,Vijay Phutane,Not satisfied with the volume,3,Sound volume is very low compared to the other boat i hv listened ....dont know the piece might have fault.i have gifted it thats y i got the problem after a while of delivery..so dont know what to do..pls suggest
boAt Stone 650,aaroh vishnoi,Fine but not best,3,"In case of portability,it does not have any cable or handle to hold. Sound is fine but as soon as the speaker goes brlow 30% battery. It automatically raises its volume to higher levels after every 2 min which disturbs a lot. Bluetooh range is also not too long. Overall 3.5 rating is fine for this product. Still a lot to done before reaching jbl level."
boAt Stone 650,Jitendra,"Good Bass, connectivity problem",3,"Bass is good, but disconnect and reconnect automatically, that is annoying. Also the voice while starting, increasing volume and power off is also not good. There should have been an option to disable voice from speaker."
boAt Stone 650,DHANESH.M,Not good.,3,"It doesn't give a 'true bass'! experience!!! Its more like a 'pseudo bass-boosting'. Even then its unclear and inaccurate too. So the overall output is not at all balanced Not at all satisfactory.. If you want just loudness, go for it. If you want clarity, this is far from it! Good for jazz or drum! Vocals-too bad!!! Returned. In the same range, Boat Stone Granade is better in terms of overall output."
boAt Stone 650,Madhav K S,Avg. sound,2,"The sound is very average, notes arent clear, at higher volume the sound breaks making it more bad. The speaker is bulky and heavy. At the price if someone doesnt have any problem when avg. sound them its ok."
boAt Stone 650,Amazon Customer,Terrible bluetooth connectivity,2,"This is perhaps the worst boat product. Bluetooth connectivity is unstable, can barely go through 1 door. Songs keep glitching, even when the phone is right next to the speaker. Not worth it. I had good experience with other boat products, but this one just sucks."
boAt Stone 650,Sanjana,Not good,2,The speaker is not good in sound quality as I was expecting..the sound is not smooth as it is in JBL speaker...
boAt Stone 650,Pratik Marolia,Connectivity,2,Keeps disconnecting automatically when the speaker is at maximum volume also buttons won't work properly malfunction
boAt Stone 650,Ganesh Singh,Battery drains too quickly,2,Battery drains too quickly Battery drains too quickly
boAt Stone 650,Sourav kalia,Can be skipped,2,Okayish
boAt Stone 650,Faiz,Not value for money,2,"Itna achha nhi hai bss thik hai value for money nhi laga, is se achhe local wale hote hai vo shi lgte h saste or achhe 500 m aajate hai or 1 2 years to chal hi jaate hai aram se or light weight bhi hote hai ye thoda heavy weight hai isliye brick jaisa lgta hai thoda halka dena chaiye na paisa dere hai 1700 Orr thodi Bluetooth m dikt h pocket m rkhne se awaz cut hoti h beech beech m baaki bass thik h volume kam hai baaki ye sb bakwass Hai moh Maya hai 100 ruppe kisi gareeb ko do gaane se jayada sukoon milega or 100 ruppe denge logo ko to 1700 hai 17 log ke face pe smile sukoon milta hai bhai..... baaki sb badiya hai thik h product boat walo ko or sasta krna chaiye Mgr haa maan liya bakiyo se sasta hai Mgr quality bhi to dekho or har chiz available nahi hoti m to boat stone 500 rgb wala lena tha amazone pe available nhi tha to stone 650 lena pada Mgr koi ni free hi aaya hai mera to kisi ko trick jaani hai to dm kro"
boAt Stone 650,Suman Chatterjee,Average,2,A very average performance. I also find a basic fault in the box's bass system - as sometimes there's bass and then other times bass is not working. It is also significantly heavy to be portable enough.
boAt Stone 650,Shabarish,Awful support and the product broke in 5 months.,2,"They have AI automated support. It takes ages to claim anything. Trash. After buying 2 Boat 650, 2 boat airdopes, 1 boat Headphone, 1 boat watch I think it's finally time to abandon Boat brand."
boAt Stone 650,Abhishek Sharma,Battery backup so poor,2,"Battery backup is so poor if u charge full and u play on full volume for few minutes it drains battery rapidly, metal net start rust within 6 months without touch of water or air, I used it rarely but it's poor quality"
boAt Stone 650,KS,Regretting !! Very irritating !!,2,"I honestly miss my old JBL Flip 5. If not the batter was ok, I would have still used it. I have been using this speaker for 6 months now. Below are the cons- 1. Annoyingly, it talks a lot 'You have plugged into nirvana, adios amigo, Bluetooth connection successful, battery low, disconnected. 2. Worst part is, at 40% battery, the warning comes up as 'Oooops batter low' for every 30 seconds while playing music. That means this speaker's battery capacity is only 60% as the annoying announcement comes up at 40% 3. Unlike JBL flip5, there is no holder/tag to hang it anywhere. 4. Buttons are difficult to operate and difficult to identify in dark with the touch/feel of the button. 5. Sound quality is poor. The bass is zero and you can hear vibrating noises at a loud volume. Pros- Nothing great to mention!"
boAt Stone 650,Yash Raj Jaiswal,Don't go for it.,2,While playing it always produce an irritating sound (Tiiiiii) along with the music which caused me Tinnitus. Now I can't even exchange the product.
boAt Stone 650,cecilia mary,Disappointed with boat this time,2,I do love boat but this time i am really disappointed with the quality. I bought it as a gift for my frnd and it was really sad to see that it was not working properly. Volume reduces automatically in this which is spoiling the entire mood of the crowd cz boat is meant to be used in parties. Now as we saw this after 7 days we don't know how to proceed and what to do . We do have warranty . Hence i request boat team to kindly look into this . We trust you and so we purchase but this is not acceptable. Kindly do the needful ASAP.
boAt Stone 650,Srini,This speaker is not stereo,2,"I purchased the speaker for 1.8k. It was mentioned that the speaker has stereo output but its not the case it gives out mono (despite having dual speakers) , incorrect details have been given in the product description. Coming to the Review of the speaker Cons- 1. The speaker gives mono output , had to return it an purchased Mi speaker , which gives stereo output. 2. The speaker sounds muffled (like box speakers) , the bass is too much and the only way to turn it down is through an equaliser but still doesnt sound that great, If you are into bass then it might be good for you. 3. The quality of the cables provided with the speaker are below average , especially the aux , a better quality cable could have been provided for the price this speaker is available. Rest everything seems to be good , the Bluetooth connectivity was good , it has an Aux input , charging type could have been type c."
boAt Stone 650,Abhijnana Mandal,Just don't buy it,2,The sound is cracking after 1 year. If the warranty is over then the item is not usable.
boAt Stone 650,Jijoyij,Battery backup very poor,2,Playing on 5minutes after full charged. Very very disappointed....
boAt Stone 650,Laxmi Narayan Meena,Battery backup didn't comfortable,2,Battery backup is low
boAt Stone 650,Placeholder,Boat stone 650,2,Value for money... Good sound quality &amp; battery life
boAt Stone 650,Vipul Anand,Performance || Battery backup OK OK .. not that good,2,Sound quality is good but battery backup is not that good. Bass Good Treble OK. Bluetooth gets too long to reconnect when started.
boAt Stone 650,Aswin,Three month review - it annoys you,2,"The media could not be loaded. The good: - Built like a rock. - Good finish all around. - Decent battery life. The bad: - All actions (power on, power off, low battery) are indicated by a voice. Which is annoying. - The control buttons on the side are not easily visible. So you need to turn the device to the side to operate them (unlike Anker Soundcore / Bose that have simple controls on the top. The ugly: - Low battery - after the voice announces low battery, the volume automatically goes to the highest decibel. Which is extremely annoying if you are falling asleep to music or have kept it in a different room. - Sometimes bluetooth pairing is not seamless. Overall, the cons defeat the pros. I would not recommend buying. Anker Soundcore is far better overall, though bass is non-existent."
boAt Stone 650,Hari Babu,Disappointed with quality,2,Sound quality is not good.
boAt Stone 650,Poor,Base,2,Good
boAt Stone 650,Solitary Soul,No Bass!,2,Regarding Bluetooth connectivity it is 100% fine. Portability 100% fine although it's kinda heavy. But Sound quality couldn't say this is the best Bluetooth speaker because there's no Bass at all..... omly treble. It's like listening to a stereo speakers without bass. When you sell the product make sure you mentioned there's no Bass on T&amp;C. This Speaker is not worth the money!
boAt Stone 650,Rohitha,"Product is good, But Amazon sent a old and malfunctioning speaker",2,"When I received a product 1st time, the sound quality was excelent, but it looks like a used one also box was already opened. So I exchanged a product, now both box was fully damaged and speaker not playing well/sound quality is very poor. I am retuening the product. The amazon customer service is excelent. But they need to provide a verified product."
boAt Stone 650,sandeep kumar,Sound quality,2,Not upto that mark .. sound volume quite low when compare to other..
boAt Stone 650,Rana Garima,Not that good,2,I bought this after watching many review videos... The sound quality is ok but the maximum volume is not too loud and it takes a lot of time for it to get connected to my laptop.. i had to unpair n pair again to connect it everytime... I even tried to get the speaker to default settings as is mentioned but that never works.. so ok ok product
boAt Stone 650,Piyush bohra,Base and volume,2,I like is quality but features not good
boAt Stone 650,Pushpak,Poor battery life and Annoying battery low message,2,"Quality is descent but very poor battery life, no indication while charging or for full charge. Getting discharge after 1.5 to 2 hours of usage. And when battery is low it is keep on playing long battery low message after every 30 seconds which is very annoying."
boAt Stone 650,Abhay Chauhan,Low Sound quality and volume,2,This product is not meeting my requirement as sound quality is not good and volume is also low as per it's price.
boAt Stone 650,Kushala,Stopped working after an year,2,Not at all good. It only worked for a year and then the sound is toooo low and not at all satisfied with the product. Please dont go for it.
boAt Stone 650,Anita Shetty,speaker volume is not very high as expected,2,"I am not happy with the speaker quality. Speaker volume was not very great. Could hardly hear for few audios and has to switch back to headphone . There is no option to return this product which is not up to mark and I am kind of stuck with this product now. I had ordered this speaker for my daughters school so she doesnt have to be on headphone all the time but this speaker is of no use . She could hardly hear it clearly.,,,,,,,,,, I am very unhappy and disappointed I with the"
boAt Stone 650,Nikesh Mehta,Average speaker. Better to opt for portronics sounddrum,2,"Average sound quality Pros: portable and sturdy. That's it!! Cons: sound signature is not clear at all.. Watched a few reviews on YouTube before ordering, but apparently non of them seems to cover these points 1. Sound is very average. Though you get a good base as it has dual passive radiators at back 2. The vocals gets very muddy as you increase the volume above 50%level 3. When connected to Bluetooth, the volume is controlled by the connected device or the speaker, either of the two . The same is applicable to aux connection. The volume has to be pumped from the phone or other connected device but can't be increased from the speaker. Company have to be clear about this... That volume cannot increased from the speaker individually, and only the connected device will help to boast the volume."
boAt Stone 650,Sundhar,Battery issue,2,Battery not even holding for even 2hrs... When it reaches 20% of battery it stopped working...
boAt Stone 650,Satish babu,Quality,2,Very poor sound.
boAt Stone 650,karthikeyan,Cancelled my order,2,I got the product and it was packed and delivered properly. When I opened it was new piece but it was not working and applied for exchange Amazon did it but this time the replaced item package was damaged heavily and the item was used one with lot of scratches. Then I cancelled the order and I got my money back with no issues. The 2nd piece which I got was working fine but there is a mild noise when ever I switchOn.
boAt Stone 650,Naveen Kumar,Poor sound quality,2,The speaker has Very Poor bass and poor sound qualitiy. This speaker is really not worth for the cost
boAt Stone 650,Boat stone 650,Battery backup,2,Battery backup is not good! Bad product!
boAt Stone 650,Maulik shah,Too bad support from company side even if its under warranty,2,Got the speaker hardly used for 8-10 days and the speaker got hanged. Contacted with the brand on their official website and logged in a complaint got it picked up with iys original packing and accessories and after 15-20 days got the speaker back but it was in a plain brown box and not charging xable and aux cable in it. Even they indicated that the speakerhas been replaced but the one i had reced is used very badlyand not mine as i had hardly used it for 8-10 days but the one i recd is almost 4-6 mo ths used u can see the image attached . Frnd do not buy this brandnot worth
boAt Stone 650,Mayur J.,To be Honest,2,"Sound and build quality is good but the worst thing is it gest automatically becomes low sound when battery comes down to 40 to 30 % . And also a backup is not good .auto volume reduction is worst thing about this product please insure while ordering this , some similer product are there in same or lower price range ..Thanks."
boAt Stone 650,Md Safiqul Alam,Not upto the mark. Far behind Sony,2,Boat stone 650 is not so good as Sony. I am not satisfied with the sound quality. Bluetooth connectivity is good. Call receiving sound is pathetic. Mic quality is very bad. On the other side of the phone gets cracked voice. When you start the device it gives a welcome note . The sound of the welcome note is pathetic. I first thought that what a rubbish I bought. But when you play songs then it's somewhat good. But not as good as Sony. Charger point is very cheap and gives a loose connection.
boAt Stone 650,Arvind P,Bogus in segment. Not a value for money. Don't buy,2,I'm heavily dissapointed. I have realised not to purchase anything that Amazon recommends as 'Amazon's Choice'. The sound heavily distorts at high volume. Looks like boAt has used quite substandard drivers in it. I had tested the sound quality on 320 kbps music and it failed to deliver the performance as claimed by the manufacturer. There's a lot of distortion in higher volumes. No sweetness in the sound.

boAt Stone 650,BRINDHA D,Disappointing Performance - Speaker Quality Degraded Quickly,1,"I purchased the Boat 650 speaker a few months ago, and unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing. Within the first 2-3 months, the sound quality started to decline significantly, and it has only gotten worse since then. Now, after just 5 months of use, the speaker automatically turns off after playing for only 2 minutes, making it practically unusable. I expected much better durability and performance from this product, especially within such a short time frame. Overall, I am highly dissatisfied with the product and would not recommend it to others based on my experience. Note : I raised above issue as ticket in boat website. I have 1 year warranty,so I raised claim request. Boat team immediately responded and picked up my bluetooth speaker and gave me replacement with 10-15 working days. THANK YOU Boat!!!"

boAt Stone 650,Sayantan,WORST EXPERIENCE READ IT FULL,1,"I purchased a Boat Stone 650 wireless speaker from Amazon on 7th August 2020. But after using it for approximately 15 days, I found some problem with the product as the Bluetooth stopped working and as a result, the product was not discoverable by any of my devices. So, I registered a complaint on 29th August 2020. As per the interaction from your end, you claimed that it would take approximately 9-12 days to reach the replaced product unit at my doorstep. But since then, it became harassment for me. Despite multiple attempts of communication, I failed to get any update of the product until I approached you via Twitter and Facebook. I finally received the replaced product after almost 1 month and 7 days on 5th October 2020. Practically, this time period has excluded from the warranty period of the product. Now, within a week, the same issue has started again. The product is not discoverable by any of my devices. When I called your executive for support, they asked me to register another fresh complaint. But with the previous experience, I am not willing to face any further harassment and lodge another replacement request from my end. I purchased the product for my personal use. But in reality, within 2 months from the date of purchase, I was able to use the product hardly for 20 days. Now, if I lodge another replacement request from my end, it will cost deduction of another 1 month from my warranty period. The product has become more worrisome than a delightful experience for me. Refund my hard earned money. Request other buyers don't buy it."

boAt Stone 650,Prateek Goyall,Very Low volume!!,1,"Do not buy this or any of the boat product for that matter. Bad experience with all of them. This speaker has very very low sound at full volume. My mobile has higher than this. And that irritating welcome and goodbye note, why the hell is it there. DO NOT BUY AMD YOU CANT EVEN RETURN IT. BOAT: perfect candidate for scrap sales."
boAt Stone 650,Pawan,Please stop and think again!!!,1,"After reading several positive and negative feedbacks, I decided to buy this product as there are more positive feedbacks. But guys, now I am sure who are giving this speaker 4-5 star rating, they know nothing about sound quality. This speaker sound seriously is pathetic. Please don't waste your money. I have used 3 other blutooth speakers and this one has worst sound quality. Wtf you will do with built quality if primary feature sound is pathetic. Sound is so unclear that you literally can't feel all beats in a music. This speaker sounds like some old 90s speaker which has just dhaammm dhaaamm and thick sound for all instruments. So please don't buy this."
boAt Stone 650,Shubhajit Das,Got used product,1,"We got a used product which was not even switching on, the logo was completely scraped off"
boAt Stone 650,Shubham Agrawal,Worst speaker,1,I have trusted on boat speakers due to brand name but its totally useless. Sound quality is very poor as well as volume is poor. My speaker sound decreases it self after 10 days and now I am not able replace totally waste. My suggestion to all new buyers.. please look for JBL only. Its costly but totally give you satisfaction and quality. I have spend 1700 for boat and satisfaction is 0. If boat see this comment then kindly give my money back I dont want replacement or warranty.

boAt Stone 650,Rajesh Guda,Warranty replacement service unavailable,1,The products sound output is not working properly. After 3 months purchase having such problem and boat is not able to provide warranty replacement service. Can not put a complain online it redirects to service center. Which is in thane. It not possible for us to go their and have replacement. Nobody is receiving calls not even boats direct number and service center people at thane n vashi. There is not even a email id with whome we can contact boat people Really disappointed with such lack on commitments by boat. I really understand the pandemic and lockdown situation but doorstep provision should be provided by boat.
boAt Stone 650,Shyam Singh,Received defective piece of item,1,"For all the new buyer's this is for you. I purchased this item in 1st March and till 21st March I was very happy with the performance of this speaker. But, after 3 weeks, it stopped charging. When I received it that time I noticed the charging port is bit loose or maybe defective, but i ignored it thinking this as of minor manufacturing defect. I was wrong n I should have gone for the replacement straight away. But, I didn't and here I am with a dead speaker. Now I have to go to the service centre and waste my time n energy. Thank you Amazon n Boat for this."

Worst service provided by company also i have logged a complaint in their website through online but till now i did not received replacement product not even replying my mails since 45 days and unable to reach customer care over phone. Finally today(15-Oct-20) luckily reached customer care team and discussed regarding pruduct issue simply got SORRY from them after 45 days saying as they don't have prodcut in stock, finally they agreed to replace product with boat 700 when i told them that will file a suit in CONSUMER FORUM"
boAt Stone 650,Madhav,Never buy this,1,"This is one of the worst products that I have purchased. This can really used as a STONE. But, for nothing else. With in a week time, it has stopped charging. After so much struggle with customer care, they provided replacement. But, this time it is better. It has stopped charging after 1 month. The battle continues. And the customer support denies replacement and suggesting to visit nearest authorized Service Center, which is 30 km far for me. Irony is [Pay money - Struggle to get value for that]."

And it is very bothering and irritating. I've ordered it and return it first time thought that this specific piece is defective but when I ordered the same model again that sound was still there. I am returning this one as well. Not saying that the product isn't good. Sound quality is great. Highs, mids and lows all are easily distinguishable. Bass is appropriate. But that whistling sound is bothering me."

Call service center , they will not respond. write it on social sites , they hardly bother . hence you will be left with a option that you need to throw it in dustbin as for 1800 item no one is going to file a case and get justice. Warranty is just on papers and home service may be provided once science will be successfully finding life at Mars."
boAt Stone 650,G Ramanjaneyulu,Poor power charging micro usb connection,1,"More than 1 year used almost 2 times i have repaired and changed the micro usb port power charger in speaker. If we insert micro usb cable for charging, then its position in speaker is tear. very delicate and 2 times micro usb soldered at mobile shops. Almost 300 rs spended even it has warranty.

Noise Buds VS401,Anurag,HONEST REVIEW OF Noise vs402,5,"Product comes in a compact small pack. It was totally sealed. 1st hand feel: Product seems better than most of the earphone which are around 1200 RS range. The design is unique andmakes it seem expensive. The quality of case is okish, the slider is good but not great, I mean it feels it would break easily if not taken care of well. You get the buds with case, extra eartips of different sizes, manual and warranty card, along with the charging cable. Functional Review: The insta connect feature is fast, it connects as soon as you open the case. The sound is good compared to an earbud under 1000, it better than average. The case must be taken care of, as it seems little weak. The sound quality is good but again not great, according to price it good. It is connecting well enough so it giving good response to that too. It the day one of the product, I shall edit and give and update after few months too for future buyers. Hope it helps. Thanks"

Noise Buds VS401,Mohammad Mahfooz Alam,Good quality,5,Good quality
Noise Buds VS401,Indroneel Das,Good for general listening and taking calls.,5,"I was looking for a generic pair of buds that are ok on music, good mic sensitivity for phone and video calls, and does not burn a hole in your pocket. This product checks on all the above. Pros: 1. I bought the white ones, and they look great. The case feels great in hand. Everything has a satin finish that gives a premium feel. 2. The top slides out instead of lifting like a flap, that makes it look unique. 3. Quad mic gives good sensitivity for calls. 4. No touch feature on the pods, so no accidental start/stop of calls or audio. 5. No problems with connectivity so far. Cons (for some people): 1. Definitely not, I repeat not, for bassheads. The sounds quality is balanced between bass, mids and highs. So if you like the deep rumble, you will be disappointed. Sounds quality is excellent otherwise. 2. No noise cancellation. You will get to hear some ambient noise always. 3. Comes with only set of buds in the box. So based on the size of your earholes, this may not be a good fit. Mine always feel a bit loose. Wanted to get some buds separately, but getting green buds is not easy. And the green color on the buds in the box is very unique, any replacement will only be a compromise on the looks."

Noise Buds VS401,Mudit Mittal,Best at noise cancellation in this price range,5,"Have been using it for a couple of months now. The most important factor for me in a earpod is noise cancellation. I bought this product after a lot of research and going through the feedback. The noise cancellation turned out to be great. I can stand next to a TV or on a busy road and the person on the other side of the call dies not hear any background noise. The voice clarity is awesome. I didn't buy it for music and have not tested it either. The only downside is that when you are using both the pods, it only uses the mic on one of the pods. So if two people want to share the pod on the same call, one of them can listen to the call but not talk on the call. Fun part is, since the noise cancellation is awesome, the other person standing close to you and shouting still doesn't get heard :)"

Noise Buds VS401,Aditya,Good quality,5,"Product is great. Sound and feel of the product is premium. Only down side is that the slider is a little shaky. And it feels like it may snap any moment. But this makes you to handle with care, therefore longer lasting. Connects automatically when we open the case, and connects very fast. Doesn't have any range issues. It is audible for around 30 meters, but may differ when there are obstacles in between."

Noise Buds VS401,Likhitha,Sound performance look valueofmoney,4,I have been using these noise earbuds from a month . It's a pretty good and cool looking earbuds and these are value of money too . In this earbuds we also have an option to control the volume through the earbuds which is not seems to happen in other ear buds . The main intresting in this device sound . It has a very good sound. We can't listen in full volume. It's a plus point for us. It's a good product to buy. The only reason for giving only 4 star is that the case is getting scratches even earbuds too . I hope the company may look forward to resolve these scratches issue. Except this Problem I can recommend u to buy this .

Noise Buds VS401,Chandra Rabha,Noise air buds,4,A product worth the price. It's noise quality is good and the playtime is also long
Noise Buds VS401,Mitul,Sound and Battery,4,Sound and Battery Backup is Good. But No protection cover is available in market and As I bought white colour so it looks dusty to soon and also lead of the case is sensitive feels like it will broke soon.
Noise Buds VS401,Placeholder,Nice Earphones with decent sound and above average build quality.,4,"Sound Quality -8/10 Build Quality -7/10 (Mic) Call Quality -9/10 Battery -9/10 Overall Really Good Quality at this price range. The Build Quality could've been much better. In just 4 days of usage the bottom of the case got scratches. The bass os not that high but the vocals are crisp and clear. Also, the mic quality is really good the other person can hear you even in outdoor because of its ENC. But note that, when riding on bike or any vehicle sometimes there is sound break. The sound cuts when travelling but it happens sometimes and could be noticed even on other TWS at this price range."

Noise Buds VS401,Smriti Tamang,Good one,4,Very good sound quality n battery last for long. One thing which I don't like about it is music automatically plays otherwise
Noise Buds VS401,Barun Singh,A value for money product,4,I've been using these buds for a month along with my Jabra Elite 65t and if I have to compare I'd say these Noise buds are quite a consistent performer sound wise and battery wise. Now the sound quality is obviously better in my previous Jabra but then that's even double the money. But if you want a loud and reliable pair of tws buds you can go for it. Also these are pretty rigid even though they might feel flimsy in hand. This photo is after a a crash it suffered from my pocket while I was on a bike ...the magnetic hold is pretty awesome and would throw the headphone out even if the lid is open. Just the fit is little odd if you like sleek in ear tws then this might be a small misfit.

Noise Buds VS401,Kanish Kumar Deb Barman,Great buds but comfort is a concern,4,"Of the many ear buds I have used, Noise Buds VS402 is functionally the best in its price bracket. ENC is good, bass is great, hands free call operation is good, voice clarity is good, gaming compatible is great. What remains a big concern though is the discomfort due to its ridiculous bud head design. It literally starts hurting the moment I insert it in my ears and I can't even imagine a prolonged usage of more than 8-10 minutes due to the pain. If you can bear through that, it's a great product in its category."

Noise Buds VS401,Priyanka Sudhakar,Great product,4,It was a great product but dont go for beige colour. It feels like like pink and not looks like beige. Can go for lilac which is good and if not go for black one which might attract scratches. Product wise it is great. Battery is good. Charging time is less and long lasting. So we can use for long time and as I personally tested it lasted for almost 7 hours of usage without charging.

Noise Buds VS401,Siddhant Bhattacharjee,Practical review after 8 months of use,3,"I've been using these buds on a daily basis for the past 8 months now and here's my honest review: 1. Sound quality - Decent for the price range, but not impressive out of the box. Had to tinker around with EQ settings a lot before they sounded good. The highs and bass are acceptable but the mids are not impressive at all. So the sound signature is pretty average. The volume is sufficient and if you manage to get a good fit, it will drown much of the outside noise. 2. Battery backup - pretty good. Lasts a week for the case and buds have given me 6-7 hrs max on low latency mode. 3. Build quality - This leaves me unimpressed as the case is a scratch magnet and the logo will fade within a month if you store it in your backpack or even your pocket. Even the buds get scratched eventually due to the sliding case mechanism. But this doesn't affect the functioning of the buds in any way, just the aesthetic. 4. Ergonomics - Good enough for the price range 5. Connectivity - Easy and simple. Connects quickly each time once pairing is complete and call quality and clarity is also pretty good. 6. Price - justified to a certain extent. But you can always add a bit more and go for something just a bit better if you're upgrading from something older. If this is your first tws, then you can definitely get one and experience the use case before upgrading. Overall rating - Solid 3/5"

Whenever I'm on call using this buds, there is always a complaint from other side stating there is so much surrounding sound from background. You can't talk to someone in a crowded place or in traffic. ENC doesn't work with mic at all. Also the case could have been better. The built of case is not that good it got so many scratches in just few days as well even after not using it roughly. Only good thing is sound is good. But if you're looking for long conversations or office related work, I would recommend don't buy this at all. Honest review."

My new buds had an issue with mic on left bud, which went unnoticed until a friend bought the same model and asked me to check. I checked and and found that my left bud was also having issues with mic. It went unnoticed because, i only used right ear bud most of the time. I did write a complaint, return procedure was properly managed. packaged was picked up and replacement was delivered from home. However, I can see that replacement product also have fault. Battery of right bud changes (shows full) in 2 min and even if we charge it for hours, it drains back in 2 minute. Company seems to have issues or may be do not have any process to check quality of new products or replacement products before dispatching to customer. I am very disappointed by the product, however two stars are only for the properly managed warranty replacement service."

Noise Buds VS401,gopammagari Rammaddilety,"its very cheep quality Technicalities, its not worthy of money its suitable for RS 599/- Only",1,"Title: Disappointing Experience with Noise Buds 402 **Introduction:** As an avid music lover and frequent user of earbuds, I was excited to try out the Noise Buds 402. However, my experience with these earbuds left much to be desired. **Product Overview:** The Noise Buds 402 are marketed as affordable wireless earbuds with decent sound quality and convenient features such as touch controls and a compact charging case. **Specific Issues Encountered:** Unfortunately, I encountered several issues with these earbuds that made using them a frustrating experience. **Sound Quality:** The sound quality of the Noise Buds 402 is subpar at best. Despite claims of clear and crisp audio, I found the sound to be muffled and lacking in detail. The bass was particularly weak, making music sound flat and unexciting. **Build Quality:** The build quality of the earbuds themselves also left much to be desired. They felt cheaply made and flimsy, with the plastic casing showing signs of wear after only a few uses. Additionally, the earbuds would occasionally disconnect from each other, disrupting my listening experience. **Battery Life:** While the battery life of the Noise Buds 402 is decent, lasting around 4-5 hours on a single charge, it falls short of the advertised 6-hour battery life. Moreover, the charging case provided only one additional charge, limiting the overall usage time when on the go. **Connectivity Issues:** I experienced frequent connectivity issues with these earbuds, with the Bluetooth connection dropping out intermittently, even when my device was in close proximity. This made it impossible to enjoy music or take calls without constant interruptions. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, I cannot recommend the Noise Buds 402 to others based on my experience. The subpar sound quality, flimsy build, short battery life, and connectivity issues make these earbuds a poor investment. I would advise potential buyers to look elsewhere for a more reliable and higher-quality buds any Brand,, Money Never comes Easley,,,,"

Noise Buds VS401,ashwin,Worst Experience,1,"I bought this product for myself to use during my gym sessions, and I paid 1800 rupees for it, expecting good sound quality and the ability to make phone calls. However, what I received was a terrible product that is not worth the 1800 rupees price range or any other product in that range. Sound quality - The sound quality is extremely poor, and the bass doesn't work at all. In fact, a 100 rupee handsfree provides better sound quality compared to this product. Call functionality - When using these buds to make phone calls, the experience is awful. The person on the other end of the call can't hear my voice properly, even if I am in a quiet room. This is a major issue for me as an HR professional who needs to take calls and conduct interviews. This product is not worth its price at all. I'm currently using a wired handsfree for my interviews and gym sessions. In conclusion, this product has been a disappointment. The sound quality is subpar, and the call functionality is practically unusable. It does not live up to its price or meet my expectations."
Noise Buds VS401,RIJITHA RAJAN,Defect product,1,"I purchased the product 5 months back.. Till now it was performing nicely.

Noise Buds VS401,Placeholder,ENC was most important for me,1,I bought a noice bud and the same product says that it has ENC feature wherein this ENC feature doesn't work at all. The product which I got while being connected to call the opposite person faces disturbance to get through. Not worth it

The buds stopped working and the case is bit big in size, very light weight and of low quality . Could have improved there . The buds are not fitting in the ear and there is ear pain and not connecting to phone easily , buds stop working on its own . Not worth the money. No noise cancellation."

I tried contacting the noise team and raised multiple requests to buy no one gave me feedback regarding this issue I only go messages saying they closed the request due to lack of information when I provided them a clear image of the product with the serial number. Don't buy NOISE products at all not because of the product quality, products are good but the support for them, if they have any issue, is very poor."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,A PHONE YOU WOULD LOVE TO KEEP.,5,"It has been a while since i have had a phone this sturdy in this price range. The M33 5G is probably the best in its segment, with 6000 mah battery life, 8 GB ram which is expandable upto 16 GB virtually for seamless multitasking. Fingerprint sensor is amazing, unlocks the phone quicker than one can say 'wha...'. The camera is good, with multiple options like portrait, panaroma, hyperlapse, slow-motion etc. You can record 4K UHD videos at 30Fps. Talking about the build quality, this phone is on the bulky side, partially due to its big capacity battery. The phone IS sturdy, and well built. Edges are not sharp, and it feels like your are holding something powerful in your hands. Battery and Charging: The box DOES NOT COME with a travel adapter(power brick/charger) as mentioned next to the name on Amazon and Samsung's official site. Probably the only downside.It has a type C to type C cable. I purchased the 25W Samsung travel adapter, which has been working great for me. The battery charges from around 13% to 100% within 25-30 mins (i never sat next to the phone to watch it charge. Well, who does). The battery will last you a day or more if you are not playing games( though it depends on what you play). And did i mention that it can support ANY video game title out there? Really. And on High settings as well. Talking about the interface, Samsung is using its latest ONE UI 4, and the UI is as neat as they come. I have not faced any bugs or glitches and its easy to use compared to the older versions making it a seamless experience. Combined with Knox security, you cannot ask for anything better at this price range. The display could have been better, since most models are using AMOLED screens, but the display is not bad at all. It has 120hz screen which is great for gaming. The screen brightness is well, very bright. Like really , really bright. The phone comes with Gorilla glass 5, so you can expect it to take a fall or two from a decent height and not worry about it. I would recommend purchasing a screen protector and a back case so you can keep it like new for long. Side buttons are clicky and responsive. The speaker is loud but mono. The overall audio experience is very good considering that. I would recommend getting the 8 GB version for a couple of thousand more. Overall, this phone is very good in terms of performance and quality, specially with the guranteed future updates from the manufaturer. So i can definately say, so far it has been very good. Definately value for money. GO FOR IT. *It has been 10 days since i have been using the phone and writing the review. I will edit this review if the need arises."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Davinder Singh Andotra,The product is good as well as economical as per the price.,5,The product is good as well as economical as per the price.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,SujayZ,Galaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability,5,"With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsungs best-value smartphone yet under 20K segment Pros&nbsp; Almost half the price of Galaxy A53 Exynos 1280 is a solid performer Excellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the board Huge performance uplift over M32 One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading&nbsp; of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf across You get features like a&nbsp;screen recorder,&nbsp;video call effects, Game Launcher,&nbsp;Link to Windows,&nbsp;Dual Messenger,&nbsp;Quick Share,&nbsp;Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others. Some of the fancy Android 12 features, like the ability to&nbsp;change the color palette&nbsp;of icons and menus based on the wallpaper and&nbsp;dim the screen for easier reading in the dark, are also included. Voice focus for calls is excellent feature, phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areas I had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using Google maps to navigate,&nbsp; signal stays strong even in rural areas, thats a positive point with good accuracy 4g Volte with carrier aggregation works flawlessly Wifi connectivity on the Dual band 5ghz router is strong and performs&nbsp; more than satisfactorily with low latency response Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity is strong and has good range&nbsp; no worries of disconnection even as far as 15 meters Audio quality via 3.5 mm jack is excellent compared to Redmi note 10 pro, much more defined and well rounded For media consumption widewine L1 support is present, Good AV experience on ott platforms, I have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering TFT LCD this panel does a good enough job . Main Camera 50mp is on par and better than Redmi note 10 pro in almost all conditions, retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos, it is able to handle extremely bright conditions well Even in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colors Good Stable videos at 1080p 4k video recording is available at 30 FPS is available Many cool camera features , boasts AR fun mode, single Take, Object Eraser and Video TNR (Temporal Noise Reduction) which makes it fun to use camera Selfie camera has good punchy colors, Samsung's way of boosted colour processing some may like it ,some may not Excellent battery life, got 9 hours of SOT despite the heavy usage. It takes around 1.5 hours to go from 0-100, and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45% provided you have 25 watt Samsungs charger Despite summer time, phone has managed to stay relatively cool, 5nm architecture helping its cause here 12 5G Bands Dedicated SD card slot is a plus here PD 3.0 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMs Promised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors, making this device more value for money in long run Cons&nbsp; Ultrawide camera is on softer side , lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media, macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details , Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this case Night shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segment Lacks some stability in Video recording at 4k&nbsp; Amoled display could have made it unbeatable Lacks stereo Speaker, but audio quality on single speaker is quite good Pre-installed bloatwares like Moj, dailyhunt, sharechat, byju's are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the box Currently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device, but we&nbsp; can expect exynos 1280&nbsp; to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updates Slightly cheap design , Chunky in size, carries some heft, Dated notch display Lack of charger in the box is a bummer, which adds up to the value cost proposition"

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Shriram Sudrik,Great value for daily use,5,"If you are looking for a mobile that gets the job done for daily purposes, then this is the phone for you. For starters, I don't play any games (temple run once a while). I primarily use it for daily stuff - WhatsApp, Surfing, News, Youtube, Maps while travelling. Based on whether I am using GPS and / or bluetooth, I get a screen on time of 6-8 hours. If you charge this phone then rest assured that you will have enough battery to last the day. A full charge will typically give 1.5-2 days based on your use. I use a Samsung 35Wfast charger which I had purchased seperately beforehand. It takes typically 80-90 mins on this chatger to charge from 10-100%. I know some people complain that it's not an AMOLED display, but for me after a while it wasnt or isnt any issue. The fingerprint sensor works most of the time, except if you have sweaty fingers. The face scanner is a hit and miss and doesn't always work in darkness. The back 50MP main shooter is good in daylight at this price point. The macro camera is as good as useless. Now comes the best part, Knox security. I purchased thos phone primarily for this over chinese phones. Samsung Pass and SamsuyPay will hold your account details and Payment card details secure. No need to physically carry a debit/credit card anymore. This phone supports tap to pay for the card saved to SamsungPay. PS: My main motivation for a Samsung phone over chinese ones was a no brainer after our Soldiers were martyred in Galwan valley after scuff with Chinese PLA. I get you may jump on me that chinese brands offer a better value for money. But i wont compromise my integrity and hand money to enemy side."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sanjoy Dutta,Performance oriented Product,5,"Delivery : It takes 10 days to deliver. Perhaps it is due to Great Indian Sale at Amazon Condition : Received in sealed pack. No complain about product condition I am writing this review after 7 days of delivery Build Quality : I am facing no issue. Build quality is solid. But remember you cannot break stone with it.. after all it is not hammer, Display : A simple TFT display but with good brightness. I feel not much difference with amoled display in my simple naked eye. After all I am not tech savvy and can sacrifice only time display or fingerprint display which Amoled can do. It is wok fine with me. Software: It is Android 12. Samsung guaranteed 2 major update.. And of course Android 13 is coming soon and one can get this update with this phone. I feel no lag in Software. Finger Print Sensor : People say finger print censor is not good. Bu I have register my three finger and it is working fine. I don't know why other people facing issues . Sound: Yes stereo sound is not there. Mono Sound is loud. Overall It is performance oriented phone. If you are not game savvy and use it just for your professional or working purpose it is good and best phone."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Anandaroop,A good phone within my pocket's reach,5,"I got this phone very recently during Amazon Big Billion Diwali Sales for 15,499/-. Initially I was a bit skeptical ordering online but reading so many previous reviews made me go for it. I tried to getting it offline but those stores which I contacted with in my city were not having this. The phone arrived and I was surprised to see that the C type cable had both the ends like C Type only. Thankfully I got another cable from my sister. I have now been using this phone for 2 weeks now and I am happy to have this phone. This phone has enough space and ram for my major activities. The only drawback I think is the camera of this phone. The Camera is not that great when compared to Samsung S21 model. But then I use phone mostly for internet purpose and my communication purpose majorly. Occasionally whenever I am taking photos, I am satisfied that I dont have to delete my older photos for making space to newer ones due to space problem. This phone is a good deal provided one has managed to buy it during online offers. Rest is up to the user. Each user will have different opinions. I shared mine too. :)"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Truly value for money,5,"I've been using this Samsung Galaxy M33 5G for a week now, so can put my review basis of this week- Pros: 1. Excellent battery life (6000 mAh is indeed a beast). I hardly charged it up thrice during entire week, along with moderate usage. Noteworthy, my mobile data, WiFi and Bluetooth are always on, with Bluetooth headphones. 2. Cool camera: I don't know if it's the highest level of mobile camera in this segment or what, but I'm satisfied with the clicks and quality of this device. I'm more of an abstract photographer, especially fond of natural landscapes. My camera does enough justice to me. Even Slow motion and Night Vision modes work just the way they essentially should. 3. Premium feel: Touchscreen is I dare say, great. I've used Samsung 8 years back as well, and then I switched to Asus and Motorola. Suffice to say, Samsung is really something else than what it used to be 8 years back, and for good. Cons: 1. Travel adapter is missing in this package. I feel Samsung should have added the 25W fast charger adapter along with the device, even for a little extra cost. I've purchased it separately from Samsung store, cost 1499/- All in all, it adds to the total cost of the device. 2. A few people might find this M33 5G a little too bulky or of a higher weight, at approximately 215 gms. I personally am ok with it, been quite habitual with this weight thing."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Md Modassar Ansari,Can't expect any thing more in 15k with 8GB version Quality product by Samsung,5,Talking about the Camera quality... Back Camera is just Awesome and front camera is best in day light but with 3rd party application it is fine at night also.. Now move to battery part its Good enough for average user it is around 48 hours and yes when you taking long time on video call it got heated... Fingerprint reader is just ok it is little bit lagging sometime.... But after Upgrading to Android 13 its performance is even more better and 5G connectivity is also best bcz it has 12 5G supported band... Sound quality is also good in both calling and music. Conclusion: it has so many features we can't write within one post.. Just one line for it AWESOME go for it without any hesitation bcz best phone ever I have used in this price range Note: I am writing this Review after using 4 months i bought it at the time of dussehra and whatever I found I have mentioned everything here. NOTE:- If anyone is facing issue related to battery please replace it bcz it has best battery performance upto 48 hours even more than it.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,SFA,worth under budget!,5,"I have opted for 8gb version, liked it! worth under a budget of 20k. The camera quality is great but not exceptional. The images are very clear. Battery - fast charges in 1.2hrs - can last long easily for two days of moderate usage. less to no usage last long till 3-4 days. heavy usage will give enough nearly a day. Gaming - not a gaming phone, yet can play medium size graphics games easily without lag, phone doesnt get too hot nor it get hotter quickly. battery backup is quite good so it would easily last long for hours. design - will fit in your pocket easily and have a good bright screen as well. not an OLED but a Full HD screen that can provide a max resolution of 1020p but not 4k. Overall - try buying this phone when it has offer. its worth a shot."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Dinesh Kumar,Very good 5G phone for the price!,5,"I primarily bought this phone to try out the 5G network - couldn't make out any major difference while I was in Bengaluru for a few days (my residence is in a place where 5G has not been rolled out by Airtel or Jio). The best thing I like about the phone is the NFC allowing me to use Samsung Wallet again. The rest of the phone's features actually seem less polished than the M33s (which was my previous phone). The phone is also bulkier than the M33s with noticeably thicker bezels. The most disappointing thing about the phone is its poor brightness - just visible in full daylight. (M33s had better brightness) But overall, I'm happy with the phone."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,"Samsung rocks, to hell with chinese cheapones",5,"Fantastic phone friends. I did a lot of research before buying this phone and i am loving it. Dont get influnced by blogs and youtubers who are paid by chinese to sell oppo vivo redmi xioami or Motorola, one plus. This phone is a machine. Its heavy cuz of 6000mh battery is worth every penny. I was worried about lcd screeen, but samsung proved that their lcd screen is equal to cheap chinese phones. Speed is brillaint, easy to handle Samsung knox security is boon. I was safeguarded from tracking and voice focus is so clear and exynos chipset is fast. Brilliant phone, i bought it at 18.5k and now its 20.5. Guys, dont for chinese phones. Beleive in samsung, they are way ahead than these cheap brands"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Utkarsh,Excellent product,5,Value for money
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sheshank Joshi,Excellent phone - Best bang for buck,5,"This is the best phone at this price range. My old Lenovo phone was dying and I wanted a new phone exclusively for my office work, with some excellent camera and some light gaming. This was perfect choice. Pros : 1. Huge battery with an option to protect it from over charging. 2. Automatic updater and app killer. 3. Excellent picture and sound quality. 4. Camera is just outstanding. Can take pictures even without proper light. 5. Facial and fingerprint recognition are excellent. 6. Processor is top notch, in competition with Snapdragon with good mqximized returns. Cons : 1. Comes installed with a lot of Samsung Bloatware apps that I don't want and not needed. 2. Doesn't be have proper screen guards or case covers in the market yet. Hopefully will change in the future. 3. Though RAM was 8GB almost half of it was always occupied. I don't think that much RAM is neede for caching though."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Anita,Real User Review -Great Smartphone at Great Price ..,5,"Real User Review for 'Genuine Buyer' looking for good smartphone - It's a great handset for anyone looking for good smartphone on a budget. (for 9ffice professionals and regular/normal users) Pros: - Robust build quality (as always maintained by samsung) - Good hardware specifications - Nice display (being a super amoled display user of my S20 FE, display of m33 is very close to that - very smooth and bright) - Samsung Software (so more secured and 4 years OS support) - Decent camera quality - Great battery life (6000 mah) Cons: - many complained of missing charger - but since this handset is having 6000 mah battery, so it makes complete sense to invest on 25 watts samsung charger as it will charge this big sized battery pretty fast. And type-c cable is already given in the box, so will have to buy only charger. (Anyway charging these new handsets with 15 watts charger takes lot of time) Verdict for a genuine buyer looking for real user review - Do not get mis-guided by false bad reviews. It's a great phone for the price point its available at and it's Samsung (so more reliable and secured) on software security)"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,MiriamiPa,"No adapter in the package, have to buy separately!!",5,"May be i didn't read properly, adapter for charing is not included in the package, have to buy separately... Review After 5 Months of Using it : If you are buying Samsung Phone never ever buy this Model M33 5G whether it is 8GB RAM or 6GB RAM, its the worst performing model ever from Samsung Phone i guess, i am not a gamer nor heavy user, but within 5months the Battery, the Speed, Signal/Network coverage, almost everything about the phone is down to Zero... not worth buying at all.... to top it all i bought this phone when it was newly launched for 20k+ and 6GB RAM for 18k+.. not worth buying at all... Samsung Phone popularity among user's also declined now i guess"

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,sanket s.,Okay phone.,5,"M31 had motherboard issue, so little anxious about this issue this time. M33 5g downside. 1. Poor software design When you change orientation of phone or switch app while eye shield is on, there is blink like inconsistency found. This phone gets time to active eye shield on changing orientation. 2. No amoled, no AOD. Samsung is toooo greedy. 3. Some apps don't run on full screen 4. Game launcher has no common feature as was found in previous version. (While blocking all notifications, there is no option to allow calls. So, either you have to allow everything or nothing at all). 5. Sometimes bit slower 6. Files app is poorly designed where no option to select view under grid view. (There is four file grid and it's fixed. Much better if it allows to view three or five files in grid view, as we can do it in gallery app). M33 5g upside 1. Best brand and trustworthy 2. Camera and skin is looking good 3. Settings page much organized 4. 120Hz screen awesome. 5. Many bloatwares are deletable (thank god). 6. Fingerprint sensor real fast."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Pravash Kumar Samantaray,Average Phone,5,"It is a good device but the battery backup is not good, I know that it has the big battery but still backup is not good. And the main thing which disappoint me that the major android updates, when I heard that it will receive only 2 Major Android update I was totally shocked. It has a 5NM processor and have the capacity to receive 3 Android update but what can I do it's all about the company thing. The OS is also not well optimised and not light. I was supposed to buy other Phone but thought that Samsung gives long update support but it discriminates better phones also."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,AKSHAY SHARDA,"Best Phone, Superb Performance and Camera Quality and 5G Benefits.",5,The media could not be loaded. The phone is best in its class. The performance of this phone is fantastic as it comes under 5nm architecture. Also the battery life of this phone gives 2 days battery backup. The Camera Quality is also very good. The Android version is 12 and Samsung provides update of next two OS updates and 4 year security patches are also provided by Samsung. With all such benefits this phone becomes the most aggressive in this price segment. The Working on this phone is also very much fast and provides fluid experience. Anyone who wants to buy the phone under 15k to 20k can go with this. Also with its 25W charger the phone get charged in less than 2 hours. The battery is also bigger in this phone and comes with 6000mah. So this makes this phone pretty powerful and long lasting. Also it supports 12 5G Bands. So definitely go with this M33 5G phone.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Awesome features!,5,"No other phone in 15.5k rs. can give you this many awesome features. Samsung does a lot of R&amp;D. loved the phone. Audio quality is good and louder than most other phones I've used. Had to compromise with the tft display, but the tft is not that bad either, not disappointing. If you are a person who likes to use their phone fast, then this is for you. The phone makes sure you have the required features at your disposal to make your work easier and efficient. Brightness is good, but nothing compared to superAmoled. All in all samsung beats all other phones in this segment in terms of software. Go for it."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ebenezer,Phone performance,5,"There are so many other issues in M33 5G devices after One UI 5.1 software updates like heating, battery drain, fast charging issue, sound quality issue, network problem issue, slow device issue"

Finger print reader 7. 3 year s/w update 8. 4 year security patch 9. screen pixel 400ppi 10. Dual sim, men card slot 11. Its Samsung 5G Minus: 1. Mono speaker audio quality not good, but with headset ok 2. TFT display, not smoked 3. Charger not supplied Overall, with all merits and demerits, I like Samsung M33 5G 8/128 at Rs 17499.00"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,nafis manzar,splendid,5,"my concern was absence of amoled but display is soo good that it feels like amoled set at natural mode, i means surprisingly blacks are inki black with no white noise on screen, colours are very natural, lamanated, very happy....used 5G jio trial...could get upto 857Mbps....speaker is good, call quality with voice focus is excellent , camera is camera, battery is nice though drains a wee bit faster on 5G network since it uses more frequencies, can handle a bit of heavy gaming too, overall a decent device apt for multiple years usage as 2 major android updates and 4 years of security update is coming too"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,vatsal,Amazing handset,5,"I am currently ussing this phone for over an year now and can say that it is very good and i am.happy with my purchase decision. The handset is of latest technology, has great ram and rom, the processor is pretty fast, the design is decent enough, and the main advantage it has is liquid cooling element which doesnt let my phone heat up"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Praveen Chiguru,Good smartphone.,5,This smart is very good condition. I giving this review after using this mobile for 6months. I'm not facing any issues. Photo and video quality is good for me.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sanjay,Works well for me,5,"I needed a phone with decent performance, memory and storage and battery, not into gaming. I got just that. Some reviews mentioned bloatware, that worried me. However I found that I could uninstall most of them, so that wasn't an issue either. Phone is working well, automatically goes to 5G whenever it gets a signal. The 8GB RAM is preset to use 4 more GB from storage. You can change that. Facial recognition is OK, doesn't work too well in low light, fingerprint reader is good and fast Decent phone overall for a decent price."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Jayesh Malviya,Ram and processor are good enough in this price range,5,"Processor and ram both are the most important when you buy any mobile so the Samsung M33 is good enough it has great battery life, processor, charging speed , ram, storage all mandatory things are good enough in this price range. It also provide the 5g service which is essential nowdays and the screen is also good and when we talk about the camera then there is no other option better then this in this price range"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Excellent phone in the,5,"Writing this review after using this for almost a month. Being a user of samsung products for almost a decade, which is very reliable and offers various range of products. This time with Galaxy M33 5G 8GB variant they have live up to their expectation in offering best of products. Pros: Battery life - with 6000mAh battery its stays solid even for 2 days even with high usage of social media. Performance - excellent with 8GB RAM variant and 120hz refresh rate its really fast. Though it is exynos Processor from usage wise you will not feel the difference. Camera - Pretty good, best that I can offer at this price range Look and feel - very stylish and cool rich color Cons: Fingerprint - as this is side mounted which is very annoying even when we hold the phone."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,sanjay jain,Value for money product from Samsung,5,"I bought it after comparing it with many other models and brands. It really suits all my needs of everyday usage, it has a very fast processor so you can use screen split and multi-app use smoothly. The processor is complemented with a powerful 6k mAH battery so it can last easily for 1 day and charge really quickly in around 1.5 hrs from 20 % to 90+. I bought the original 25W adapter along with the mobile and hence, I received discount of 5% and in all, I bought mobile+ charger for 17k which is a good deal considering the RAM, processor and 5G. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a premium looking phone as all my friends couldn't believe that it is under 20k as the mystique green colour gives it a premium look and the weight is evenly distributed so feels comfortable to use as well."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Pratik C.,Samsung M33 5G one must buy,5,"So far the configuration which I was looking for has met based on ram, rom, and processor + battery capacity which is simply awesome combo. I was looking at the configuration for processing point of view rather than the display. People who is looking for the display then it is tft tech rather than the latest currently used or available in the medium range mobile phone. Although medium range mobile now a days don't providee a dedicated micro SD slot which is totally not TRUE in case of galaxy m33 as it has a dedicated memory card slot to expand the memory. Which is quite handy and easy to manage. The drawback I could easily see is the camera pixel which could have been more at this price as well as design and especially tft display (old tech) and lastly bit overpriced."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,SHIB SUNDAR CHANDRA,Value for money,5,"smooth and clean UI experience. Decent camera quality. Though saw some reviews complaining about the camera but I haven't noticed as such, it takes great pic even under low light, at night and the front camera is 8MP but it's better than the 20MP camera of some phones. In-hand feel is also good though it weighs heavily (215gm). The display has a TFT panel but produces vibrant colors, no issue with the display, it looks the same as AMOLED until not viewed from side angle Cons- expected AMOLED display, heating issues while charging, expected much slower battery drainage as it has a 6000mAh battery, adapter not given"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ashish Thakre,Very Good Phone in this Price,5,"Nice Phone, Whatever you can get in this price you will get it. A basic android/ Samsung user is looking for dual sim, additional memory card, good video experience, all day battery backup without power bank, stylish mobile in hand, finger print and a good Camera. Everything is in one phone in a affordable. Go ahead with this phone, i got it in 16499 when there was some offers going on credit card. Value for money. Now its showing 18499/- still a good price for it."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Aarti Susan Kuruvilla,Enjoying my newest upgrade!,5,"I bought the Samsung M33 5G the day it released, and I've been using it since then. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my new phone! The phone is buttery smooth to use - transitions when switching apps, the ease with which I can have multiple apps running simultaneously, etc are great. The camera is really really good too - with minimal effort, photographs can be clicked with good quality and clarity. I had a Samsung M30 previously, and even though the price difference isn't that high, this felt like a HUGE upgrade as the phone feels premium. Another difference I noticed is that the phone is definitely thicker than my old phone, but it's still very comfortable to use. I'm still exploring some of the features as it's only been a few days, but I'm loving the experience so far!"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Good mobile phone,5,"It is very good mobile phone as per price for almost everything, games, social apps, browsing, internet is 5g! and the functions! I have been using it for more than 1 year. Trusted one from my side."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,YOGENDRA TRIPATHI,Excellent phone,5,I have been using Samsung mobiles in last 3 years after Motorola &amp; my confidence is now with Samsung phones as well. M33 5g is a best series in this price range &amp; build quality is good. Look wise you can't say unique. It is looking like redmi phones. In the package charger is not included hence cost will get higher along with charger. Only c-c type cable available that means with this cable you can not connect your mobile with your PC. Overall phone is good &amp; will recommend to all. &amp; if your budget is Lil bit higher you can wait &amp; Go for M53 5G which will be launch on 22nd April 2022.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Vinesh,Best quality budget mobile.,5,"Good quality mobile at a cheap price. Pros : Its 5G. Battery runs for 2 days if mobile is used in power saving mode &amp; used only for calls with minimum browsing. Otherwise battery lasts for the whole day even if we use our mobile very frequently. Memory storage has outstanding capacity of 128 GB. Camera is also good. Inbuilt Call recorder is outstanding. There's also Screen recorder function whereby you can record any videos which you see in your mobile on Internet, Youtube etc. Cons: Does not provide Battery adapter. Fingerprint is not that good."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,himanshu c.,Very Satisfied with the Phone..!,5,I was previously using Samsung M31 for 2 year and till now it haven't given me any technical problem. This phone made me upgrade to Samsung M33 8gb Variant where I bought and used it for 2 weeks around and its a very good phone The screen is very good. And the camera also is very good . The processor is fantastic multitalsking is very convient and till now it hasn't given me any problem likeag or hanging and also the noice cancellation option while calling is very usefull. Overall its a very good phone and budget friendly. I got all the option available in high end phone. I loved the phone..! I recommend others to buy this phone.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ashi Meer Ali,Amazing product,5,"I am using this as my primary device since a week. Pros: 1) great battery life 2) good display, you won't realise the difference between tft and amoled 3) good sound quality it is loud.! 4) the phone handles multi tasking well 5) feels premium for a mid range phone Cons. 6) good camera quality 1) phone is slightly heavy 2) would have been nice to not have spent 1000 odd rs. On a charger but then again Samsung clearly mentions what is in the box before you buy it. Even with the extra charger cost the phone is great at this price point."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,BHANWAR LAL LOHIA,For you,5,It's nice.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Arpit Chopra,A good buy,5,At price point of 18k i would say that its a good buy with the experience of samsung's ONE UI 4.1 with android 12 and 5g with a latest 5nm processor and its battery backup is just amazing thanks to its 6000mah battery and regarding its ips display its an okayy type of display but as we all know that samsung's amoled is the best so kinda missing that one coming to its camera in day light it captures great photos with main camera but ultra wide images are somewhat soft as its a 5mp one and selfies are also good at this price point. And its photos Are close to natural images. N its back design literally looks above average regardless of it having a plastic back.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Preethi Avula,All necessary features covered,5,"Moving from galaxy S10, was a bit hesitant. But after using for 2 weeks, am very satisfied with battery life, dual SIM data feature, camera, dedicated microSD slot, etc., Have to check how 5G works when I travel out of India in next few days. The cons, which are not huge, are that no charger is included and hence had to order a 25w Samsung charger, screen being LCD - the blacks are not as black but overall not bad at all. Compared to S10, M33 is a little heavy and thick because of the huge battery. Most features that I use on S10 including Samsung Pay, quick access pane, secure folder are available on M33. Overall, very happy with the decision to move to M33."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kindle Customer,Good,5,"I haven't used any heavy apps like games or such. Based on my general use, I would say this phone is a great quality phone with all essential as well as extra features. The battery life is a bit short especially if you continuously use it(one day would be the maximum with extended use). Selfie camera is good but the rear cam isn't that good when using it at extended zoom. Other than that it is a good quality all rounder phone after taking into consideration that I got it at more than 40% off."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,ruby P.,M33 5G,5,Good
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ashok Kumar Sharma,Decent quality ( Read full review for all important information!),5,"Overall a budget phone. Processor is good enough android 12 and other specs are pretty decent . Camera quantity is good for normal user , battery life is insane. At first phone might seem laggy but it's because of the animation speed , slow it down from settings ( huge difference after turning off and turn off high contrast text too). Display is TFT but colour are sharp and attractive if it had amoled it would be unbeatable. Other things are good overall a very good mobile for a normal user . Will last about 2-4 years easily without any physical damage."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Princeeleojoseph,Heat resistant,5,"Display was good like purchasing the product in real shop.And heat resistant.The packaging consists of charger wire,sim pin and tempered glass with manual book too good camera quality is good like the brand name go for it SAMSUNG"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Manik,Good Quality Product from Samsung,5,"Bought this phone for my father and he likes it. Interface is good and screen has fair quality. One UI is nice customization of Android. Further it has good camera and video playback. Good for video calling as well. Battery life is decent. Phone doesn't come with a charger and you have to buy it separately. This phone is Made in india, in case you want to avoid Made in China products. The phone has 5G capability and shall make it future ready."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Arun Shivaswamy,Value for money and excellent product!,5,"I purchased 8GB/128GB variant and I must say the performance is great! The battery lasts for 1 full day even upon extensive usage. Display is very clear! Sound quality is not great but just Ok compared to my old phone Samsung OnMax. Overall, it is value for money and I cannot imagine I narrowed down again to a Samsung phone even after a decade of using only Samsung phones. This proves that Samsung produces great quality products at affordable prices!"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,JITESH,A decent purchase in the price range,5,"Its been around 20 days since I purchase the phone for my wife. The phone has been working perfectly till now. Screen , camera, Battery are all behaving as expected. Due to 6000mAH battery, the phone is on the bulkier side, but that was an expectation. Also we hoped that the earlier samsung charger will perform fine with this device but unfortunately it takes a long time to charge with the same. So absence of a charger along with the device does hurts a bit, but again a known fact while buying. Overall, it seems to be a happy purchase till now."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Vishnu,Loved it.,5,Been using this phone for 3 days and it is absolutely flawless. The battery backup is very good inspite have a 120hz panel. Don't worry about the tft display. I was previously using a phone with amoled display and I find no drawbacks in this display it's same. The user experience of Samsung's OneUI 4 is quite good. The camera is upto the mark and have many features. The processor is good and the extra virtual ram is a win win. The only issue is that it doesn't come with a charger (adapter).
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,M.SUNDARESAN,Flawless performance,5,Most of my relatives using the same model. Influenced by them I purchased this phone.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Utkarsh Raj,Great device,5,Don't be confused just because of exynos processor. Just buy and see the performance. Its fantastic with zero lags. I have not played games and by the way i am sure most of the people do not play pubg like games others it can handle with charm. Looks premium and the display is also very bright and colors are punchy and 120hz adaptive refresh rate is a plus.

Service centre said motherboard gone. ....... At this price range there are plenty of options but I wanted a Samsung phone, because my previous phone was a Samsung too (J7 2015 Model) which lasted for more than 6 years without any problem.

Using it for more than a month now and didn't face any issues so far. The only downside is, it is bit heavy so you may feel a bit of pain on your fingers when you rest it on them for longer time.

What stands out is the fingerprint reader, it's quick. Charging takes almost 2 hours for a full recharge considering below 10% to 100%. Overall impressions is good and qualifies as a good midrange performance smartphone. It does not come with a charger/travel adapter and charging cable has both ends USB type C.

Other user experience is seamless and I don't see any flaws, battery performance is not bad, voice clarity, music, phone calls, accessibility are awesome. Moreover durability of Samsung is far ahead compared to recent players entered, overall worth buying."

Network Connectivity :- Samsung is very old company in telecom as compared to these new Age smart phone manufacturer, and believe me Samsung device are far far better in connectivity as compared to other my all old devices from chinsed manufacturer always struggle with network and connectivity issues but this device is lot better if your prime aim is to communicate and do calls 2.5. sound &amp; speaker:- There is feature of clear sound in the phone ,which is good for long time calls &amp; speaker is loud enough for You tube content consumption 2.6.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Benjamin.G,Best Smart Phone under 18k,4,"Galaxy M33 5G review, Initially impression looks good feels good but heavy while holding. I am an Iphone user but to get into the Android world i need to backup my Whatsapp data. If you are an Android user then it's easy to back up Whatsapp data in google drive but for Iphone users it's not that easy. Many may be aware that Whatsapp data backup can be done using Samsung devices which run with Android 12. It took nearly 2 hours to complete data transfer from Iphone to M33 device. With datas backup, Now I can switch to an Android device without worrying about data transfering. Unboxing - Box looks slim like a Higher end smartphone, so you can't expect Charger in the box. In Box it has Handset, Sim ejector tool, Type-c to Type-c cable and warranty card. Lets see the Pros and Cons about M33 Display: Pros - 120Hz refresh rate with 6.6 inch TFT LCD display and other features like HDR10+ support. It has 1080 x 2408 Resolution which comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Overall it looks like a premium mid range phone. Cons - At this price Amoled display could have been a better one. Body : Pros - Looks like a solid body built with Plastic body at the back. Cons - Toooo heavy to hold with Phone thickness of 9.4mm and weight over 200 grams. OS &amp; Chipset : Pros - It has a chipset of Exynos 1280 5nm processor with Android 12, One UI 4.1 out of the box. Which is good at this price range. Cons - Snapdragon Chipset would be better. Storage : Pros - Internal storage comes with 128GB and 6 &amp; 8 GB variant Ram and also Supports dedicated MicroSD card. Cons - NA Camera : Pros - Pro mode available. Nice portrait with 50 MP camera. 5 MP Ultra wide does decent work. Cons - 50 MP camera doest take good pics some places over coloured and over shade in pic and 2 with Micro and depth given for name sake. The 8MP selfie camera doesn't take good selfies but can be used for Video calls. Battery : Pros - 6000Mah battery comes with 25W Fast charging and can be used for a couple of days for day today usage but if you're a heavy user then maybe it lasts for 1 to 1.5 days. Cons - Toooo slow to reach 0 to 100% It takes nearly 2.5 hrs with other fast charges but with Samsung's 25W Fast charges it takes 1.45 Hrs to complete 100% Other Features : It comes with Bluetooth 5.1, Wifi - Dual band, Wifi Direct, GPS, NFC, Reverse charging and Samsung Pay in it. Conclusion : If you ask me, Best Premium mid range smartphone for overall performance but if you need to purchase it as a camera performance then you need to consider other phones with same spec."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ashish Kumar Rohila,Nice phone so far,4,I purchased it for my father . Perforis decent for normal day to day usage . No complain at all.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Darshana Kumari,A budget phone,4,"I am writing this review after using this phone for two months. First take a look on Demerits - 1. Most of the time fingerprint doesn't work. 2. I felt 5 and 6 days ago that my screen stopped working for few seconds after that it came to it's normal mode. 3. There is no app lock in phone. If you want to keep your gallery and other applications locked, you need to download app lock from play store. 4. For night, Camera is not upto mark. 5. No charger, only a type C cable. Merits 1. Battery backup is good. 2. Screen is good but no comparison with amoled screens. 3. Knox security, which is my favourite feature of Samsung. 4. As I am not very fond of pictures, so for me camera is good. Conclusion I am not completely satisfied with my new phone because of fingerprint sensor. I purchased this in Rs15,999. Samsung could provide better in this amount at least an adapter and amoled screen. But you can go for it because other features are good and phone is working smoothly."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Karthik Loganathan,A decent phone thus far however not been put to a full use as a Primary phone,4,"Got this phone as a spare phone to have Indian sim card on it and to use during our trip to India. The phone itself is a bit bulky and rather heavy. The display on the other hand compared to our other spare phone (the M31's LED) isn't any bad at all as this one has an LCD and 128 Hz refresh rate which is pretty decent. Battery is not yet tested much, however it seems to last for days with Wi-Fi turned off and with Wifi ON it seems to last for 2-3 days at least. Since it has not been put to real use of a primary phone which we may do when we travel we are quite skeptical about it. Haven't tried to listen to music, watch videos or play games tbh. We had to uninstall the loads of Samsung bloatwares off which was quite necessary. The box lacks adapter which might be a bummer for a few. However since I live abroad I don't have a need for the adapter. The other trouble is the idea of having finger print scanner on an odd place. If you have a case then the finger print scanner gets intruded a bit. But for whatever reasons, perhaps due to the display, camera, simplicity of the android UI etc., my wife kind of gets curious to try it over her iPhone XR. We will try to use it with an NA sim card in the upcoming days and I will post an update by then."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,K,"Great Build and Huge with less expectations, Do not buy as you can't exchange",4,"Updated on Oct 24th 2022, do not buy this as you will notbe able to do exchange offer on any new mobile... Mobile is good with what it comes with like 6/8 GB of RAM and also with 4/6/8 gb of additional virtual RAM, which needs 4/6/8gb of storage utilization from your 128GB of huge storage..which is actually great.. Performance wise yes its good but the chip been used may last only for one or two years.. who cares after 2years.. mobiles are out dated on released date itself.. so this doesn't matter.. Cameras are at most good but front camera not good.. so phone is not for SELFIES.. Screen:there are plenty of comments,videos and blogs that phones screen is not good.. but those reviews are totally wrong and have been provided before phone's release date,without having phone in hand..thats not good... But yes, screen is not value for money you are paying...but its comes with great refresh rate and colors are fabulous.. Chargers: am pretty sure each family member have good or say average phone with c type charger in home now, so why to waste money..there is no point of buying new charger.. its not atall bad thing..but yes at this price, charger would have be part of box.. Other great stuffs like wide angle camera,gaming performance, weight, body and build quality, touch n feel..all good.. Overall for 2 to 3 years use with budget less than 20k..go for it.. i got on offer on first day sale..so it was less than 17k for 8gb variant for me..great deal.."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Raj,"Overall good, could have been better",4,"Purchased 8GB option for my mother and overall it's good buy at 17K after discount. Following are some of my experience sharinh after using it for 3 days: Pros: - Big 6.6 screen but not heavy to be honest. Ocean blue was cool pick. - Massive 6000 mah battery, I need not charge for first 28 hours inspite of heavy usage - Camera is descent and taking good pictures from both front and rear. Please don't expect to click like Samsung flagship - overall good display inspite of TFT LCD. Was pretty bright and smooth thanks to 120 hz refresh rate - Daily usage between multiple apps was handled pretty smooth including streaming in Netflix Amazon hotstar etc - Not much gamer so cannot comment on this - liked Android 12 and latest one Ui 4.1 and haptics is really good Cons: - Amoled could have been provided at this price range. Samsung need to learn from realme and oppo - No charger adapter was disappointing. Need to spend extra 900 rs for same - Even though bottom speaker was pretty loud, stereo speakers could have been provided in this range - Always need to press side button to on display. Double tap on screen is not available here Overall if you want Samsung only at this price range then can go for it without second thought. Otherwise you have realme or oppo or poco if you want amoled screen charger, dual stereo speakers etc..."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Saraswati Chakrabor,Best budget 5G phone by samsung in Rs 20000 range,4,"1.Fingerprint is useless with cover[any type] they should have built on screen or the back of phone. 2. Camera is good works well 3. Doesnt heat up a lot. Hardware is okay with handling most medium use tasks and some low level heavy tasks such as basic photoshop editing not for advanced features. 4. Battery stands 6 hrs usage give or take 30 min continuously youtube playback. 5. The screen could have been amoled at this price{dissatisfied} but bigger size is good. Overall, the best phone for light users[yes i mean those people who dont even see the settings and dont know what most of it means(both young and old)], okay for dedicated amateurs and the tinkerbells[ people who are amateur gamers OR know the phone well and what most things happen when they make the phone do things], and lastly worse for Pros bcoz well if u are u know what i mean. Bought this for my aunt she is happy. # Finally if u are thinking of this just buy it without question bcoz u are getting similar configuration to all the Chinese smartphones. boL"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Jayanta Dhar,So-so kind of mobile...,4,"First, I bought it (during Great Indian Festival for Rs. 14499) for my mother and she is extremely happy with it. Secondly, Samsung mentioned it has a 5nm processor, though the speed does not demonstrate that at all even after opting for maximum RAM usage (i.e., 8GB+8GB). Third, the main sensor 50mp is quite nice to click daylight images. I won't say it struggles at night as the result is 'not so bad'. Fourth, touch sensitivity is awesome. The screen is well protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. One must use a screen protector as the screen is quite slippery (take this as a positive point). Fifth, already updated to Android 13 and it's really a great experience till now. Sixth, the battery is HUGE, although doesn't have its effectiveness in day-to-day usage. A fully charged 6000mAh battery does not run for 2 days (even with less usage by my mother. I think the culprit is the update and hope Samsung will fix this issue shortly). Seventh, the design is good (if not great). I like the overall design language of the mobile. Hope this review helps. Take care."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Uditansh Patel,Good MidRanger with slight caveats.,4,"The Camera and Battery life are excellent and best I've ever used yet. The screen could have been AMOLED but the 120Hz LCD is fluid enough. The software needs to be optimised for the Exynos 1280 chipset though. The Chipset warms up quite a bit because of the unoptimised software, which could be improved with a future update. Talking about updates, uninstalled the Moj, Josh etc bloatware but it gets reinstalled with every update which needs to be fixed. One thing to note is that the basics are right, the antenna reception is really good. I lived in a hostel in a remote place with limited connectivity and used a Redmi device earlier which used to create problems in placing calls but with this device, the network problems have reduced drastically and now I don't face as much problems as I used to face earlier with the Redmi. Call quality is also excellent with an added perk of Voice Focus. Also OneUi4.0 even though unoptimised yet feels generations ahead of the software on other OEMs phones."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Manoj Pednecar,8 Gb Ram Hence Faster,4,"Everything is excellent about this phone except the Face Recognition which doesn't work if light on the face is slightly less .And the Finger Sensor, instead of on the back side of the mobile, is on the side On/Off Key which doesn't work properly since the space on the side Key is too little to recognise the Biometric. Moreover, for the Screen Shots one has to use the low volume key and on/off key simultaneously, which is cumbersome unlike M30 model where just swipe of screen is enough. Other functions seem to be good although it's too early for me to comment, since I bought the phone just 2 days back on 10th June 2023."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Arrijith K M,It's a good phone if your need is good software and battery life.,4,"It's been a week since I bought this phone.. There are some pros and cons which I experienced are listed below.. PROS: 1. Though it's LCD Screen, the picture quality is good and smooth 120Hz screen with good viewing angles. 2. Best Android UI. 3. You feel like Samsung is (iPhone in android) bcoz of it's battery optimisation and smooth software. 4. I'm charging my phone only to 85% bcoz I'm keeping my phone in battery protect mode.. My boy is coming down to 25% after two days of medium usage.. So it's good.. Best battery life you can see in this mid range. 5. It's a okish camera and 8mp camera seems to have more clarity than 16mp selfie camera.. 6. Having HDR support. CONS: 1. Phone is heavy it's nearly 215 gms.. 2. Charger not included.. ( Samsung must understand that people who are buying smartphone under 20k expects charger in box. And there may be some people who are buying phone after 5 yrs. ) 3. For 6/128gb variant it costed me 19.5K for phone+charger+case+temperd glass... So keep budget like that.. Atlast.. If your smartphone need is like good software and battery life with promising android update means go for this phone instead of POCO X4 PRO 5G. If you need gaming means go for POCO X4 PRO."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sandeep Chauhan,Why are Samsung store people running this phone down?,4,"Its just 6 days since I received the 6GB RAM version for my son on 19 Sep 22 after reading some pretty decent reviews. Its still early days to pass judgement but so far so good! The big difference is its LCD screen Vs the newer AMOLED tech. However keeping an AMOLED besides this on the same image, couldn't make out too much of a difference with the naked eye. And that's the point right? However what surprised me was the derogatory feedback of the salesman at the Samsung store at a nearby Mall for the whole M series. Like, this is a cheap variant made just for Amazon. So obviously it will have a whole lot of compromises. When I called his attention to the 6000 mAh Battery, his response was obviously, it was required as the not so fine-tuned hardware consumes more battery therefore larger power is required. Is all that true?"

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Arijit Bhattacharjee,best buy budget phone value for money,4,After horrible experience from Flipkart bought this phone from amazon and got delivery on 30/09/22 After using it till 11/10/22 I would say this is the best decision made by me to purshase this budget smartphone As I got it around 13.6k with charger on sale time So far pros are 1. Super fast processing 2. Display is good for TFT and 120hz refresh rate 3. software experience 4. Premium samsung features 5. Original 5G support 6. gaming mode Cons 1. Battery life is low since the phone runs 5G and being a slight heavy user I would say its okish and runs around 24-26hours with heavy usage 2. the phone is slight heavy for plastic but as it contains 6k mah battery its ok But it looks premium and its a eye catcher... 3. Camera should be updated ***Will update this review after 3months using
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Firdous Rafeeq,Satisfied,4,I m happy with the purchase.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Gaurav Singh Bhati,"Solid, well balanced phone.",4,"I bought this phone at 16499 after instant discount of 3000 on ICICI Bank credit card. So at this price point, it's a good deal. Now I have divided the pros and cons in the list below after using it for around 24 days. Pros: 1 Good battery life 2 Decent back camera 3 Type C port 4 It has a headphone jack 5 Capability of NFC functionalities 6 Smooth UI 7 It has 5G capability for future 8 It has Gorilla Glass 5 protection for screen Cons: 1 Speaker loudness and clarity is not satisfactory 2 Back is plastic, not metal 3 No notification LED 4 Phone is a bit thick and heavy, I guess due to big battery of 6000mAh 5 Has a number of pre-installed apps 6 Doesn't include charger in the box, it has to be purchased separately 7 It also didn't include a basic back cover or even a simple screen protector So, these are basically my observations and opinions about what the phone offers in practical use. I may update these pros and cons upon further experience."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Shriram,Cost Effective Phone,4,Recently I purchased M33 phone from Amazon. Delivery experience was good. Price was 20k but in Amazon sell I purchased in 14k. Impressive phone. Samsung has provided lot of features in this phone competitive to Chinese phones Pros 1. Excellent Battery life due to 5000mah 2. Screen resolution is excellent eventhough it is not Amoled. 3. Good refresh rate 4.Good camera 5. 5G phone with 12 bands. 6. One can increase RAM upto 16 gb 7. You can uninstall additional installed apps( In Chinese phones you can't) Cons 1. No charger in the box so one need to spent Rs 1200 additionally. 2. Phone is heavy and big size While choosing this phone main competitor was Real me Narzo Pro 50 . I will say it is like a Hero Splendor as it offers all required features in optimum cost. I am proud that I purchased Indian manufactured phone.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Will never order from this seller ..each and every flower faded very next day,Budget friendly,4,Samsung always tops the lists in mobile phones for middle class people too .. Super brand ..
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Best product in price range,4,"Loved the mobile with build, battery backup, camera quality, Amazon Pro: Delivered right on time, and easy hand over by delivery person. Hats off to them for being timely in such hot summer. Amazon Con: This was delivered with just a hard paper box. I ordered sony BT headphones in past, it came with secured package. With this mobile it was just a hard corrugated box package. Not happy at all. Samsung Pro: They got the best product in this price range. A real Value for money. Samsung Cons: 1. Should have included a complete set of accessories like wired headphone, adaptor. It is not too much to ask for. This is my first samsung, maybe in future I'll think of buying a product with all accessories included in box. Hope it reaches to Samsung and will be considered for other incomplete packed product range. 2. Device heats up while charging. Maybe due to recent hot Indian summer, such devices should be designed by keeping this point in mind. 3. Audio jack should have been placed on top instead of bottom."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sovan,Few hits many misses,4,"I have been using Samsung note series since Note 1 days and hence didn't had much expectations from m33 as second phone. But it packed some good surprises like a bright screen, very decent camera (for its price point), awesome battery, peppy design and 3 card slots + 3.5jack (I need the card slot which is now not there in flagships, hence I needed this phone). But it also has snobby Samsung signature mistakes. To mention a few - 1. Just too much samsung Bloatware 2. No full fledged multi profile support like stock android. Only secure folder of Knox. 3. Manual adjusting of display brightness. This is the most annoying thing. Even 10k phones these days has auto brightness 4. Software bugs - after accepting a incoming call at times I'm asked for permission for microphone access! 5. Occasional lags 6. No Dolby Atmos, no digital audio 7. No amoled, though colour is quite punchy. 8. Wifi and Hotspot can't work together. 9. Speaker volume fluctuating of its own Most of these can be fixed with software updates and hope Samsung will be doing that."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Navaneeth,Good product from Samsung,4,Got it in affordable price. Quality product.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Aaryan,Decent 5G phone,4,"* Display: Though just TFT but feels much better than most other brand's IPS. As of now it doesn't support HDR playback in YouTube but F23 in the same price does. * Performance: It has new and smaller chipset but that doesn't reflect much in performance. No lags on normal usage though. * Camera: Main 50MP camera on rear is great considering the price segment. * Build: Entirely plastic but the display has Gorilla Glass protection. * Battery: On normal usage would last 1-2days. Due to large battery it is quite heavy. With 25W charger it charges quickly. * 5G: There are other phones which have better offerings for the same price but it is a 5G ready phone unlike others. Considering its a 5G phone, overall it does the job done for the price."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Rajesh Dalal,Fine phone with 5G,4,The features are not working as good as described.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Excellent value for money,4,"Inspite of comparing all other phones finally pick this one with hesitation of display quality and phone weight. Finally both where satisfactory and gave hope that pick was right. Display looks sharp and Vivid u won't find different unless compare with amoled screen, weight management has been very well managed. Yes No charge provided was disappointing. Apart from that felt everything was excellent. Premium fell, solid in hand, call quality, cameras quality was good compare to other brands in this price range, especially samsung one UI with tones of options with adv free experience well done. Definitely this would be the best pick right now compare to all other brand phones if ur looking for future proof many 5g bands and trustable brand with good service support all over the world."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Shreyash g.,Better still not the best,4,Samsung's budget phones were not that competitive in the budget range people only brought because of brand value and a good customer support but this phone changed that for me it has specification to compete in budget range and gets an edge due to brand value so i bought it. Front camera of 8mp is a disappointing for selfie lover although picture quality is not bad. Processor is better than sd 695 which most other brands are going for in budget range. Screen quality is good but amoled could be there but i guess that increases the price tag so can't complain about screen. Charger not there is not so good but that has to be some business strategy I don't get why. Competition is giving chargers samsung don't. Battery is a huge plus point no doubt. Overall positives overweigh over negatives for me and I got the phone. No complaints till now not even minor nuances. Go samsung.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Hemant Ojha,Using the phon for more nine months,4,Phone is running very good specially battery . Only problem i got and unable to fix is using otg for pendrive etc.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Nilkantha Chatterjee,Good phone to buy,4,I have been using this phone for almost 1 month. Overall experience is good so far. Some featurea are not available which is highly expected from Samsung. No default App Lock is provided. Network speed is not available. Music player has to be downloaded. Back Camera is good but 8MP front camera is not up to the mark. 25W charger can charge battery in 1.5hrs. Knox security is good to use. Protect Battery by 85% full charge restriction is also present. Display is okay okay in bright sunlight.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sonam Tshering,"Good build quality, decent looking and is working fine.",4,So far so good. The build quality seems good ans its a heavy phone. The response seem to be good. When I bough this phone there was supposed to be a 5% cash back if we used ICICI Amazon Pay card but it seems like a hogwash since I didnt received any money. When you are proceeding towards checkout it says that your card is eligible and we hope that once youve made the payment you would receive the cash back but its been few days now and nothing has come.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ritu Singh,Excessively heavy weight,4,"This phone is excessively heavy that I used to hold it in both my hands Whenever I keep in my hanging purse my shoulder started feeling uncomfortable After some days of purchasing I found some problem in clicking photos, the click button is not working at that time I couldn't talk properly on the phone due to its heavy weight.... Before this I was using Samsung galaxy A6 for 4 years.... It was such a light weight fantastic phone... Now I am thinking that my decision to go with M33 was wrong"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sree,Good,4,"Phone is ok. It has all the features required for a normal user. However, i had faced problem with exchnge. Amazon has come up with a new rule, that order has to be placed from the mobile you have to exchange only. I ordered a phone for my mother, so the phone to be exchanged and the phone from which order is placed are not same. There is a two step verification for this and 2nd step verification didn't go through, due to this difference. Had to pay the exchange money, to take the delivery. They should display this rules while applying for exchange itself."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Nitesh,Smartphone is good enough for daily use.,4,"It has everything for normal user like me. But sellers are not providing genuine seal of packing. I received phone and found its one seal was broken but 2 other seals were ok. So suspected that it is genuine or not or refurbished. I hope it is genuine. Photo quality is excellent. Battery backup when you charge it 100% at 6 am and use internet, game etc. moderate use the it will discharge up to 50% by 3 pm. Means it has super backup. Phone is fast. Touch is excellent. Overall network coverage is excellent."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,BP-Amrita,Glitchy performance and not the best modem,4,For the price this is just an ok phone. Lot of lag in touch responses. Seems to get hung even on basic phone operations and touch feedback. I am not using this for any games or heacy apps. Just basic use for email/work/whatsapp related. Faced call drops and audio issues. While using same airtel SIM in another Samsung phone - everything is perfect. no call drop/audio issues. Not the best modem inside. Couldn't test 5G yet. no coverage in area i stay. Adaptive display doesn't work on this phone. Unpredictable performance. Manually adjust brightness. After using stereo speakers - just 1 speaker at bottom feels very odd.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Regular purchase,"Good performance phone with avg camera, Exynos processor",4,"I did extensive research before buying this phone and now that i have it , here are my two cents: Good affordable option for: People who install a lot of apps Watch netflix etc. Mostly Surf web Take calls Want long term android update support For gamers, I am not sure if they should buy, Antutu scores show Exynos competing with snapdragon processors, but there might be heating issue when gaming for long term. Camera is decent, based on its price segment. Highlight of this phone is it software: OneUI is very smooth, and very stable as compared to oxygenOS etc. Good update support. Samsung Pay Samsung Pass (password manager) Secure folder, knox security Call recording (not working for me presently, but option is given) Cons: Charger is not included. You can buy it at 1100/- (official 25w). Also buy a case, without it you will feel the phone heating and hand might sweat over long use."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ravi Baisla,Value for money,4,"Itne pese me best hai mobile, sound and display and battery is good"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Tushar T.,Decent phone in budget,4,It just works fine if camera &amp; gaming is not your prime use. Mostly works best for seniors. We now have 2 of these in our family.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Arshi qureshi,M33 5g phone,4,Nice quality features good quality camera overall nice phone I like it
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kurien T Kuttiparampil,Ok phone,4,"Nothing great but nothing bad either. Similar to a lot of other 128gb, 8gb phones in the market and sort of ok for the special price of 17.5k, but might not be worth the actual price of a little under 20k. Cons 1) heats up during charging and whenever else the phone feels like it 2) buying a charger, which is not included, will cost 1.5k more 3) camera not at all great 4) other than Samsung printed on the back, nothing much in terms of build quality to differentiate it from competitor( sometimes cheaper )phones with similar spec... Pros 1) separate earphone jack which is a must for me 2) 2 Sim cards + 1 micro SD slot available 3) display is good 4) battery charges up quite fast and battery life is as expected"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Y,Too Heavy,4,"Battery Not bad , It is around 30% after 19 hours of normal usage,just surfing and social media and installation of apps. Camera. Better than expected from review. Front Camera of 8 MP was supposed to be bad as per review but few selfie in lighted shop have come Good. I am used to 25 MP selfie of Samsung A 50. Internal Storage. 128 GB is good storage, But after installing Apps it is showing 33 GB used, Rest of the space will be filled up by Cache and WhatsApp. Edit After 1 week... 1. Screen. Sometimes hangs, doesnt respond. 2.Camera Day light 8 MP Front camera good, Same thing at home with all lights on gives 2 MP or less feel..."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Anoop,Ok ish phone with overpriced tag,4,"I had been using M 31 for quite some time now , had a cracks on the screen that's why this one. Pros Big phone ( subjective) Back panel is good compared to M 31 Speakers are good Fingerprint sensor works fast And battery Cons Display is ok not good ( no amloed) Phone is heavy No adapter ( don't know why Samsung does that in the segment) Software is Android 12 out of the box and one UI 4.1 is good. Camera is again subjective Selfie camera is not good Main camera unit is ok by not something grt. Call reception is good And the SAR value is on the high side with the handset. Thanks"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Jitu Prosad Saha,First time in the range samsung provide a good product.,4,"Samsung provide a good phone in this range , its processor, battery life, charging time is too good, fingerprint scanner is so first and good to use, 50 mp rear camera is good provide nice photos but it may be little work on camera colors and detailing .it might be updated via software update hope so. But I am little disappointed with the 8mp selfie camera, its take nice photos in full light, but in low light its not provide better selfie and screen flach is medium it also may be correction via update. But if samsung provided 13 mp selfie camera in this phone its to better. Ovarall the M33 5g phone is good to use."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sukumar B.,Inspection of the Mobile phone Samsung M33 5G delivered to me,4,The phone suddenly heated up abnormally for which I complained and your inspection person visited twice for which I am very much thankful to you. Ultimately the said phone has been returned to you as being a old man (75yrs) I got panicked of using modern mobile phone which I have heard several instances of bursting of phone leading to fire. Thanks Sukumar Bag
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Brilliant phone. Good value for money.,4,"Samsung is a well-known brand and one of the largest selling smartphone companies in the world. This M33 5G smartphone therefore can't go wrong vis-a-vis customers looking for a state-of-art fully-loaded phone for a competitive price. The performance is brisk. Battery is amazingly long-lasting. Speed and storage match any latest arrivals in the market. I would rather the phone company had packed and sent a 24W fast-charging-adaptor along. When you sell an elephant to a customer, it's so natural that you sell them the small magic wand that help control the pachyderm. Right?"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,marshal,Battery good,4,"Heavy weight, battery good. Display, camera can be improved. Some of the 4K videos stutter to play. But for the price of 14.5k plus cards discount and exchange offer, it's a steal. Android 12, fluid opening of apps, no hangings. Con : Couldn't install Hotstar ott app due to non compatible of software version. Samsung helpdesk said the same. Hotstar app is not shown in playstore for this mobile model. A very red card . Hopefully they come with update in near future."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,ATHUL,Worth for money,4,Excellent camera. Good battery backup
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Prashant priyedarshi,MI users would be disappointed...but samsaung..duh,4,"Battery is as expected,camera too... They don't give you charger so I bought one for 430... there is no shortcut for taking screenshot so you have to stick to the old school thing like holding the two buttons together and one of them is your f8ngerprint sensor...that's weird and there are many more things that you are troubled by if you have been an MI user...coz MI phones are so user friendly... but overall not too much troubled with it... sometimes it gets hot like rarely but it does..."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Mahendra,All good except travel adaptor!!,4,"Travel adaptor is not in the box. You need to buy it separately that cost around 1200 INR approx or under 300 INR if there is any offer. Look and feel: it's good. Love the Mystique green color Camera: Good quality pics in both daylight and low light in evening and night Performance: it's good after using a week Battery: it can run for a day or more, depends on the usage Game: I have not checked any, but I think it will work fine Recommended but remember no travel adaptor with any samsung mobile... SAMSUNG is trying to earn more money by selling travel adaptor"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Good phone for the price,4,The phone is good for the price. I am using this for past 10 days. I switched from Redmile note series. The key issues I have A) The app lock feature of redmi is very critical in any modern app and I miss it. B) Not having amoled is a real bad point and it shows in my usage on office chores C) Battery is not great (good not great) considering many apps use location and Bluetooth. I won't blame Samsung but it's 2022 and I was expecting their next-gen batteries. All other functions meet expectation for the category and is reasonable for normal use.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Pratap Reddy,It's not like samsung,4,Ok
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,R C Nandrajog,Mostly in line with the earlier Samsung phone. Therefore change was easy & smooth .,4,"I do expect excellent Quality from Samsung &amp; till date, I have not been disappointed. This set has a better sound performance &amp; colour display than my earlier two sets."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Mohit maheshwari,a good product.,4,"i purchased it for rs 15999.00. in this price not bad deal. when i update apps then it was heated as like ordinary mobiles then no any cooling system was working as company says. selfie camera not up to mark. i purchase a c to use charging cable and use my old 9v adapter, it take 3 hours time to fully charge. reat of all are good. screen is well, not feel the lack of amoled display. one thing disappointing that when i charge mobile the charging information display not show after screen off. when use dark black wallpaper then screen seems like dark brown instead of dark black, may be due to unavailability of amoled display."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,ARUMUGAM,Good,4,Good
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sojan,Good product and worthy for the money paid,4,"Good product. Not available in shops, available only online. Worth for money paid"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ak. DAS,"It's a great phone, only drawback is Adapter",4,"Its a great phone, no doubt has many features that you wouldn't see in Chinese phones. Major drawback is Adapter not provided, yeah that's killing it. Otherwise everything is good, it has good camera quality, yeah even the front camera (8mp) takes great selfies that you wouldn't see in redmi phones that may have higher pixels. I was fed up Chinese phones (specially Redmi) that's why I chose this phone, yeah I knew it's not providing charger but Type C to C cable is great."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ravinder Singh,"Good for pictures, battery",4,"Battery backup is amazing, sound quality is good, looks wise it's beautiful, takes good pictures. though it hangs a little bit rarely, and doesn't comes with a charger."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Gopal S.,Best of dis price,4,Good
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Vishal Parmar,says 5G Handset but Not 5G software. Can't use 5G..,4,Samsung can further lower the prices if they remove the Battery somehow. Customers can buy Battery separately. I mean seriously this is the height of manipulating prices. First they removed Earphones from boxes and now Chargers. Camera looks OK if not great. Shall produce another review soon. 2nd Review: It says 5G Handset but 5G Software is not there. Checked for update but it's already up to date. Can't use 5G.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sachin Sharma,Audio jack faulty/damaged,4,I never used audio jack as I am using ear buds. Today my buds battery finished so I tried using normal ear phone but come to know that its faulty and unable to use it....
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,muralidhar s,Avoidable Samsung mobile,4,"Friends, frankly this mobile from Samsung can be avoided. There's nothing special except Knox security. Those looking for big battery beware. The 6000mah battery makes this very heavy and with a tempered glass and back cover it becomes uncomfortably heavy. As for 5G, my advice is not to rush to buy 5G mobiles right now. 5G is seriously draining battery. My 4 stars are for Amazon for a safe delivery and a decent exchange experience. You will definitely not experience this with Flipkart."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ayan,Battery monster.,4,Currently on day 1 and here's what I feel: Pros: 1. battery battery battery... given a SOT of around 9hrs and at 25%. 2. Good quality screen don't get upset by TFT. 3. Bluetooth output is good. 4. Fingerprint sensor is snappy. Cons: 1. It's big and heavy so your pockets are gonna feel it. 2. Dated design. 3. Doesn't support dual 5g but there's dual 4g. Still exploring it.... will share my experience after a month. UPDATE: it's just irritatingly laggy
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Swaroop Patil,Good for below 20k price,4,Pros: 1. Good quality for below 20k price. 2. Battery backup is decent if not heavily used. 3.Camera is not bad. 4. Fast refresh rate and smoothness. Cons: 1. Overheats if used for heavy activity (like gaming). 2. A bir on the heavier side. 3. Lots of bloatware but u can uninstall them or at worst can atleast be disabled. Overall a decent product for the average phone user with a not so big budget.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Soumesh,Okay phone not the greatest but bang for buck,4,"The media could not be loaded. day 1- packaging was really bad, no bubble wraps nothing but the phone is thankfully okay. Camera is alright and the screen is good too, doesn't look like cheap tft displays. Turned off 120 hz because that was laggy, samsung shouldn't put that in lcd only works well on amoleds. Anyways, overall a good phone. I know there are better options in this price range obviously but I'd rather not buy chinese products so only good choices left are samsung or apple and apple doesn't the most affordable tech out there."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Shashank Shekhar,Go for it .best phone,4,"Loved the color and looks of the phone. The charger is not provided which can cost u extra money. I missed reading about the contents in the box. Rest all features are good. Samsung is as usuall having nice hardware and good operating structure. All 6 mobiles in my home are samsung only. Should have provided with the charger to be more worthy at the price. 16999 is the price which was worth buying, camera quality is also better. Battery life is very good."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Decent phone to buy,4,"Few things I have noticed since the time I am using this phone. When I leave my phone screen faced down, 2 gears appears on the screen and stays for an ample amount of time. Iwant to understand if it's normal! I have also experienced slowness, frozen screen alongside with screen fluctuations while using an app., like it was trying to open a new window then close consecutively. If there's something I can do about all this, I want to know!"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,jigar sheladia,"good budget phone,,,, expectation more but itna paise me itna hi milegaaaa........",4,i am using this phone since 2 days... earlier i used motorola g5 plus . good things of this is display is tft but better than other company mobile hardware is good. after continue using 2 hrs it is not hitting.... rear camera is good.but in zoom or big screen some picture are blur front camera is not good. 8mp is not sufficient... why i choose this phone my preferance was good hardware and battery life... convincing use in day to day .. camera is not my priority 128 gb and 6gb ram
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Very bad policy not to have charger and non combatible charging cable.,4,Very nice product but very unhappy Customer first time with Samsung. Associated more than.a decade but this policy is rediculuous.Cost cutting is good practice but not at the cost basics. No battery charger is in the pkt. Moreover surprise is the charging cable is not combatible with my old charger. No charger different charging cable .Means buy a new mobile but u cannot use is. New charger will cost u 1200 extra. Very bad policy. I will never ever buy again.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,ASHISH DEV,A GOOD DEAL FROM SAMSUNG,4,I have been using this for almost a month now hence in a good position to review. Its a good phone below 20K. Processor and Surfing is good. Camera is good but not the best in class. Battery is best in class. 8GB+128GB gives ample space with speed to browse throughtout. Its a bit bullky. Look and feel is awesome. Just a few wifi issues with watsapp connectivity. Overall 4 star for this cell phone. If you are looking for smartphone below 20 K you can go for this.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Surajit Bisai,Nice,4,"Battery backup execellent, cool gazate, Nice camera, 5g experien is good. I recommand this product. But Price is little bit hi. Charger should include."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Got what I needed.,4,"This phone is a big improvement over M32. Never faced any lag or heating issues. Smooth perfomance for everyday tasks. Big battery, so I don't have to think often to charge it. I don't play games on mobile so can't say about that. Android 12 with OneUI 4.1 is a big plus. For 16,500, this phone worths to get considered. Cons: Buying the charger separately is really a turn down. Samsung offer of getting charger in 300 could have been on amazon too."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Varun,Good phone,4,While it doesn't have Amoled or UFS 2.1 the TFT makes up with better sunlight legibility. The biggest sore point was the lack of charger. Got only USB C to USB C cable which is pretty much useless for connecting older PC and laptops which don't have USB C. And the charger 25W costed a bomb. That's terrible from Samsung. My dad has M31 which was latest at that time with better camera better screen and better storage with charger and USB C to USB B at less price than this.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Saksham katiyar,Decent phone,4,Only for Samsung lovers It is somewhat laggy after 6-8 months of usage Although recommended around 15K
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,pravas majumder,Good but bulky,4,Product good bt bulky feel
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Alok P.,Looks stylish,4,Received my phone before 3 Weeks. I wouldn't suggest to go for it.. not worth it at all. Cons. 1. Poor Camera Quality 2. Poor Video Display Quality 3. Very Heavy in weight 4.One drawback also is no charger included in the box. Camera and Video are the first features. Selfie Camera pics looks like a old VGA Camera.. reminds me the Quality of old small feature phone. Video Quality on even youtube is vert bad. Was having high hopes from Samsung but disappointed badly.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Mahek bharat doshi,Good budget 5g non chinese ( brand ),4,"I have order this phone on 14th January 2023 and as i have order through amazon so expecting within 2 to 3 days however it shows February 4th 2023 and received on 25th January 2023 still need to improve in timing but product is good in budget, looking non chinese and good brand with 5g support"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Basil,Budget phone from samsung,4,"Primium look with high battery backup. 1 hour to full charge from 10 to 100 % when using 25 w charger. Camera is average with good colour tone capture. Brightness is Normal than normal TFT display. Not feel display is TFT. Support 2.5 , 5 GHz WiFi . Processor Speed is good for Normal users mail , camera , browsing and gaming too. It's a good and primium look Phone From samsung m series. Highlight features are battery and Android OS 12 . Knox security is an advantage ."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Prasanth V,"Best affordable,stable Android 5G phone",4,"I was a Motorola user since years. Since I got this phone, was a fan of thus affordable stable Android 5G phone. Impressed with it's features, stability and build quality. Camera quality was good. At pat when compared with other mid range phone models. Hesitated to buy this earlier, but after buying and using it, felt satisfied. Battery lasts long even after using OTT apps like Hotstar etc. No charger is the only disappoint but rest all good with thus phone."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Samsung M33 review,4,Pros 1. Back Camera very good even in this budget. 2. Front camera also good. 3. Very fast with 8gb RAM 4. Good 6000 mah battery 5. Speaker very loud 6. Android 13 7. 128 GB internal memory 8. Dedicated memory card slot 9. Bluetooth 5.1 10. Fast fingerprint reading Cons 1. A little bit heavy 2. No charger with pack 3. Only one Sim can act as 5G at a time.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Brand value,4,Go for Samsung if you are looking for durability and style.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Rohit Raj,Good Product,4,"Phone is good, camera is just little better than average at price range. Few glitches with operating systems, need to be careful before giving any permission to any of the app like malware protection as well as these starts interfering too much with other apps functionality. Battery life is really good works well for two days for about an average office going user."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Raju K.,Cellular,4,Very good
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Natarajan,Average phone with minimum performance.,4,"Though Samsung brand phones stand first place, this model does not fulfil the needed requirement at lower price. Other features are better to some extent but one can go for higher model with little more cost."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,thik hai,best,4,best
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sujith Nayak,Good but not a great phone under 18k,3,"Bought this phone in June 2023 and have been using it since last 6-7months. The battery was working fine and in fact good until suddenly it started to drain. Now, I have to charge it everyday with minimal utilization. The battery is covered under warranty but Samsung service Center is the worst. They will make you run pillar to post for the battery replacement. I guess most of the users might not face this issue, but I am an outlier. That said, the mobile in the first glance is heavy for it's size. Anything above 200g will make it feel heavy especially in your pockets and while operating. The mobile also looks thick with no sleek features. No Amoled display so colors and hence the videos or gaming experience is not top notch. The only thing that you can buy this phone for is battery and that in my case wasn't good."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,GOPAKUMAR T,Good,3,Good
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Arnab saha,Everything is great except tft lcd display not even ips lcd.,3,"Design : great but heavy at 215gm with rugged case 230-240gm, back panel get some fingerprint but not too much. Holding grip is comfortable. It get scratch easily so case is definitely needed. Display: TFT lcd not ips lcd but 120hz is Smooth. Color accuracy is ok, slightly dull in hdr videos, not vibrant like Olde or amoled. Brightness is more than enough in indore but in sunlight it manageable. Yes display is the pain point of this phone. Processor &amp; performance: multitasking is not a problem at all with 8gb ram &amp; umcp 5.1 not ufs 2.2 storage (umcp 5.1 is better than ufs 2.1 in both read &amp; write speed but not matches the ufs 2.2 write speed, so you get the point ). Heavy games like COD mobile, apex legends playable at low graphics with max (60fps) fps. Heating issue starts after 40-50min in winter. Its not too hot to hold, you can play a game. Camera : main camera take decent photo with decent hdr and contrast &amp; enough detail, 50 mp mode take more detailed shot. 5mp wide angle camera at 17499 is painful but ok to have atleast samsung camera software makes the magic to actually produce a usable wide angle photo. Other 2 mp lens forget about that. 8mp Selfie cam take good photo with good details in well lit condition. Night mode on rear is okish but selfi night mode is not ok. Battery: heavy uses at 60hz fixed refresh rate gives 9 hr screen-on time with highest software tweaks &amp; optimization possible. With 120fps it will 6hr maybe. Light uses easily last for 1 day. 0-100% Charging at 15watt it will take 2hr 35min . with 25 watt 0-100% it charges 90-95 mins. Software: oneui is oneui where it absolutely shines. With 2 yr android update and 4yr security update. Last android update at dec 2023 and last security patch july 2026. It comes with some bloatware but most of them can be uninstalled. Only 4 samsung bloatware (galaxy store,theme,max,cloud etc )and one Microsoft (one drive) can't be Uninstalled . No ads within oneui software(except lockscreen glance and Samsungdiscover widget), ads in 3rd party apps is not a fault of samsung. If you want a phone that works no matter it's specifications and security &amp; privacy is important to you then choose samsung over Chinese brand. Smooth flawless user experience. Update 21st july 2023 Main camera does absolute job no complaints except night time ( not unusable photo but has some grain/ noise in low light condition ) I usually charge my phone upto 85% with inbuilt charging protection option given in samsung battery management app and use it until it's 20% then give it to charging and it takes 54 minutes (at 25watt) to charge from 20% to 85% While 65% battery gives me at least 6 hr of screen on time. &amp; another pain point that it has no builtin app locker &amp; network speedometer. On the flip side it has call recorder without announcement and a gimmick (voice focus for voice call clarity enhancement) that works better than advertise. Fingerprint reader is works like 8 or 9 time in 10 attempts. Yes it something it doesn't works on 1st attempt and also when the finger is wet."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,vinay rana,Battery is low quality,3,Battery is low quality
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,sateesh prakashrao shinde,Hang problem,3,"After using approximately 10 months,I faced hang problem"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Madhuri Lugun Tati,(1)USER FRIENDLINESS (2) SOFTWARE FOR DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS,3,"1) There is problem with sound. Person on other side mostly says not able to hear my voice. It is not Tower problem as speaking to the same person at same time from other brand phones there is no problem. Whenever I have purchased Samsung the problem of sound is always there.Also it is not a Setting problem of Volume key. In previous 4 button phones the output sound was very low and I had to increase manually each time a ohoe comes. Each time a new phone call comes I have to again increase as it drops back to previous low level. 2) This is the first time I purchased a Samsung Smart phone HOPING that it will be better than its next competitor. I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT IS NOT SO MUCH USER-FRIENDLY. IN THE SAME MENU YOU CAN NOT NAVIGATE TO DIFFERENT OPERATIONS. 3) ONE BIGGEST DISADVANTAGE OF this smart phone ( Must be true for all other Samsung Smart phone models ) is the STORAGE OF CALL RECORDINGS. IN SAMSUNG ALL CALL RECORDINGS ARE GOING TO ONLY ONE FOLDER. SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS SOME DISCUSSION WITH ONE PARTICULAR PERSON THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE HUGE CALL RECORDING LIST ,GO ON CLICKING EACH CALL AND AGAIN LOCATE THE SAME CONTACT CALL. THIS IS REALLY CUMBERSOME AND GREAT TIME CONSUMING. I had been using the Smart phone of the Competitor so long .I very happily found that all Cal recordings are displayed below the Contact and you can easily locate the call recording and save enormous time spent in Samsung. 4) TOOLS- There is NO Tools Folder . The Competitor has Tools Folder which keeps all frequently used Tools in it- Like Calculator, Scanner ,Voice Recorder,COMPASS,Clock ,Downloads etc in one place and you can quickly select that. Here you have to go on searching each. These are the reasons I say Samsungs software is much less user-friendly. I WONT BUY IT IN FUTURE. MY COMMENTS ARE FACT-BASED AND NOT EMOTION BASED OR AFFINITY BASED. AS I EXPERIENCED. 5) MOREOVER this 5G is quite costly. The Charger is not being supplied with the mobile. You have to purchase it separately. So with the mobile price you must add the charger price to find out the SET price and compare with competitors' . The Redmi also does not suggest what existing Charger will work ,if some one has that. ALL COMPANIES MUST SUPPLY WITH THE CHARGER AND QUOTE PRICE. I WISH SOMEONE TAKES UP THE MATTER WITH CONSUMER COURT AND THE COURT PASSES ORDER TO ALL MOBILE COMPANIES TO SELL COMPLETE SETS ONLY IN ONE PACKING."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Nilakantan Gangadharan,M33 not so good,3,"The phone is now 1 year and 4 months old.So far so good for the price After warranty period , suddenly it stopped charging Problem not with charger or cable."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Average Product,3,I am writing this after usage for 2 years. Mother board is fine and mostly needs replacement. Service guys simply says it is normal with Samsung to have problems after 2 yrs to have issues with hardware. Bravo Samsung!!! Will think 1000 times before I buy any samsung mobile now.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kalyani,Charging the Mobile M33,3,Mobile phone is sleek and stylish butyou don't provide charger's adaptor - so bought a an adaptor from play store - original chord doesn't fit into adaptor - please provide adaptor as well n charge the same
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Gautam R,It is a Decent phone.,3,"Read multiple reviews etc and brought the phone. This is my 1st Samsung phone, Never had a Samsung Android phone before. Just listing the Cons I noticed: 1. Finger print sensor is not that great. The sensor button is so small, If you have a Silicon cover it is difficult as your finger is blocked 80% and you have to put some efforts to touch it and get it accepted. I used MI phone before and had a dedicated large finger print sensor in the back and feel that was good as the sensor was accurate and had a large surface area. 2. Android 12 is great, But is slightly sluggish. If you used a faster phone before, then you need to get used to the minor slowness. It is slightly slow, But not bad. 3. Camera is OK, Again if you want to shoot photos then you need to buy I-Phone or a Higher priced Samsung phone. 4. Battery is 6000maH, But seems bit it drains faster, But still is not bad. If you are using it very frequently with some Intense Apps running in the background (Not Gaming) then will last for 1 - 1.5 days max. 5. 5G Network selection is only possible with 1 sim at a time. I did not get the option to select 5G Network on both sims at the same time. Once you select 5G on one sim, then the same is removed from the other sim and becomes 4G. Overall it is a decent phone and if you get this on a discount then go for it or you can look for better options."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sandeep Yadav,The Front Camera is below average but ok,3,"Got fot 17,500 (8gb/128gb) First impressions are quite good and I will update this later if I find anything. Weight - well distributed all over the phone, feels light compared to 5000mAh phones. Plastic - the phone is not in a box design like that of iphones, it is like old phones in hand feel. Camera - below average camera of both front and back, the back cameras quality can be justified in thi price segment but the front camera is horrible as hell, the phone lags in the front camera, can't take decent photos with it. The front camera should at least be usable in this price range. But ok for video calls and etc. On using the 25watt charger the charging is fast, like 1.2 hours from 20 - 80, the speed is good, phone surely gets super hot at 80% charge on 25 watt charger, so I recommend plugging it out or switch on that don't charge over 85% option. Any other questions you can ask me directly at @yadfish on twitter I will answer you. If you are thinking to buy it over Chinese brands, I would recommend it to you, but if you want Amoled, dual speakers then increase the budget and you can go with A34 5g or s21 fe 5g, or in Chinese you can go with Redmi note 12 pro series or Iqoo equivalent series."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Nitin Negi,Good phone for Parents not for Genex.,3,"The media could not be loaded. Phone is beautiful , good processing power! Only worth if you get it between 12-13k. I am a samsung lover , so bought this for dad and 5g is out here in my city. But my dad is not happy with camera. Now lets talk about cons! Yes... Camera is pathetic only good at bright sun light! Lil heavy ! Slow internet connectivity which i think will resolve after the update. I got it at 13.5 for which i am satisfied! Oh yeah TFT screen but thats not a con!! Those who are not taking it for dispaly then i must tell you i use iphone 12 and i compared the 4k videos in both and felt like m33 is more vibrant. Definately Amoled is amoled but it can be ignored! Rest up to you! Its your money ! Invest smart! Atlast just want to say too much cost cutting for just 5g! You will get loads of feautures in chinese like realme , poco, redi!! But UI is best in samsung! You will get updates for next 2 years! good service center is another addon!Rest up to you! Its your money ! Invest smart!"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Bad performance,3,"Very bad performance since starting time.But Amazon policy has played very badly when I wished to return it within it's allowance time. No Representative did visit physically to check the mobile at door,rather they give a false checking statement to Amazon on it's performance by checking through an App from their office. I repented for purchasing it through Amazon."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Imraz Khan,Camera is too bad. Software issue as well.,3,"I bought mobile at good offer price. I am a samsung lover. This is the first time, I am disappointed with a Samsung mobile purchase. Camera is very poor. Performance is not great as other processors of samsung mobile. I dont like finger print sensor on side of the mobile. Mobile thickness is more. I am also facing some bugs issue. while i operate the mobile, automatically it goes back to previous step.. Automatically Undo the step. I have to contact the service center now. This is the first time I am also taking mobile to service center. My earlier purchases were great with trendy samsung mobiles of that time."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Avinash,Good product,3,Good phone. Not so good for new generation. Not a gaming phone. Otherwise camera is good. Processor is good. Hang issue As usual Samsung phone.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sudarshan B.,Decent product,3,Decent product. But cost is high. It needs to reduce to atleast half d price.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Good mobile but can not say value for money,3,"Earlier was using Vivo V9. As compared to that it is a bit heavy. Lot of bloatware as was the case with Vivo V9. Basic Vivo was packed with features which were easy to use and for the same price e.g. screen sharing/mirroring, screenshots, etc. It is a bit complicated in this one may be because of my learning curve. Felt cheated when Samsung provided only chord and had to buy charger separately. It has C type connectors at both ends. So had to but another cable for charging in my car/ with laptop just in case. My earlier mobile screen went blank and had to make a distress buy. I have a grudge against Chinese as I do not know what data they are stealing and hence stayed away from Vivo, Oppo, Motorola, etc. and went for Samsung. I am aware that a lot of things Samsung too gets from China. If you ask me whether one should buy this mobile at 19K price then would say it is a bit high on price for the features it is offering."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,MM,A BAD PRODUCT. Don't buy it,3,"The touchscreen reaction time is slow. Many apps , including that of Whatsapp don't work properly. No way I could change the size of apps in the home screen. Grid size change was missing in home screen. The power cable jack is like a local market stuff. A very bad experience indeed"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Speed slows down. Overall average phone.,3,Phone processor becomes slow after 1 year usage. Don't go behind Exinos. Battery still good after 2 years. 1 day usage can get.when 5 hours used. Only android 14 after updates stopped.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,AOLED display not available,3,The product designed by Samsung by introducing their own processor which is under trail and cant compare with snapdragon or mediatech. Screen is dull as its LCD not LED or AOLED . After every reboot it takes long time to start screen and some booting message of Samsung software came. I will not recommend this product at all you can go with other companies for the same feature with OLED OR AOLED display as your eyes will get trouble to adjust each time brightness and no sharpness .
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,krishna,Budget Phone with ok features,3,"Samsung M33 not great but Ok. 1. Camera 50mp quad! My 5 year old sony mobile(23mp single lens) for better than Samsung. 2.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Yash L,Was expecting more,3,"Leaving a review after 2 months of usage.. Although my first impression of the product was good but eventually, it changed and didnt carry forward.. My usage is very limited to call, few songs audio /video and no games. Even with this usage the battery is not able to survive one full day(24hrs).. 90 to 30% happens within 12hrs.. Camera quality is average Phone lags at functions when you are very fast of changing screens,apps, etc.. Have been a samsung users for years now but I sincerely feel, this is not Samsung I have always experienced and hence, was expecting more."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Vaz,Buy the Adapter. You have no choice,3,"My rake after using it. While the ram, storage, refresh rate is great. The screen display is good What just kind of sucks big time is speaker and camera which is just kind of average. However what makes you feel cheated by Samsung (wish I could right this in bold) is the type C cord which doesn't have a USB side to it to plug in another existing charger or laptop. By this you are forced to pay extra for the adapter which is steep. And yes like Redmi, realme, asus which I have bought earlier, they don't provide a protective back guard cover with the phone.. so once again pay extra there. These are purely my observations .. serious don't care if you differ in opinion"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Lock Screen Does Not Wake Up Upon Receiving Notification,3,"I am using a Samsung M33 as well and facing issues with the lock screen which does not wake up upon receiving a notification. Why is such a basic feature like Screen Waking up upon Notification is not working for this phone and also many other buyers are facing the same issue.. Moreover, if Samsung is aware of this issue why are you not working on fixing this issue with a Software Update. How can a phone which is priced for almost 20K does not have such a basic feature that a 10K Android phone provide. Absolutely disgusted with this purchase and this is how you lose a customer forever. Rest assured this will be my last Samsung mobile ever. I will also ensure that no acquaintance of mine ever gets my recommendation to buy a Samsung phone. Pathetic !"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Not user friendly for phone calls or message typing.,3,"Bought it a few months ago. Since then my phone is not reachable on multiple occasions, and occasionally I am unable to make outgoing calls. Writing a message is a difficult task now as the glide option malfunctions each time and have to individually type the letters. Photos are fairly good. But some portions are hazy. Size is big. Personally would have preferred a smaller phone, handy with one hand. Weight could be reduced. Memory, speed is good. Fingerprint reader is not very great. Have to touch multiple times."

Battery draining too fast very very worst mobile . Automatic switches off. Hangs I recommend not to go for this PHONE unless seriously SAMSUNG resolves the issues . AMAZON/Samsung should give the replacement &amp; extend it up to one Month replacement free of Cost similar brand or other brand option. One week is too short for replacement. Somebody like me gifted it to my Sister. By the time , my sister started using it was 18th Oct."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sachin,Poor response and camera,3,Not the best option for clicking pictures and gaming. Samsung really needs to go easy on animation and software updates for each and every thing and instead work on response time.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Vikash,Phone is good BUT camera is worst in the given price range.,3,"Phone is extremely bulky, like holding a power bank or hard disk. Not a good-looking phone. No Amoled display, it sucks without it. Camera is exceptionally worst, blurry and full of noise. Colors are not good even in daytime. Slight stutters while using for long time or doing updates and all. Speaker is very loud but No Bass. Rest all if fine 120Hz full hd display is good, battery is good, charging speed with 25watt charger is 1hr 25mins, fingerprint is very fast, has knox security, ALT-z, secure folder, samsung pay, NFC, and all the features you can ask for. Just a Okay-Okay phone, thats all"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Madhav Saraf,Buy it for average use,3,"First thing first, I got worst experience of delivery with Amazon ever. As an Prime member expecting product in 1 or max 2 days I received it on 10th day. Product status was showing reached at my nearest hub but delivery agent delivered it as per their convenience and delivered me at some other location. Anyways, about mobile, It is average product, display doesn't seem to be Super Amoled. Back Camera is okay not good but many new features are there like object eraser, stickers, etc. Simply, the one who has very basic usage with phone can go for it."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Rishabh Jain,Pricey without a charger,3,"Can't comment on the product as it is only few days, but it hanged a few times for sure. Samsung Company should also put screen protector to your mobile please. Also either charger should have been provided or some discount coupon should have been provided to buy samsung 25w charger. Re Delivery - on time delivery but a major issue on delivery style. Your person don't call, don't ring the bell, just put the package in front of the door and leave. If I did not see the delivery notification, I would not be even aware of it. Even someone could have took it away from outside of my door if I did not picked. Amazon please improve your delivery style. In my apartment there has been a significant increase in the wrong deliveries by Amazon daily."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Na. Vijayashankar,Life expired in 3 years,3,There was motherboard problem....in 3 years....Disappointing....My next phone cannot be Samsung....
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,gayathri acharya,No charger Included,3,I have got this phone delivered 2 days before. But very sad part is that Samsung is not providing charger along with this mobile phone. There are many chargers available and not sure which is the good one. very difficult to decide and again you need to spend around 1000Rs even after paying big amount for the phone. I selected one charger and it says 13 days needed to deliver the charger and no early delivery options even if we are ready to pay extra money. So need to wait for 13 days to start using it .
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Good phone for everything except gaming,3,"Pros : good phone you will have no problem browsing instagram, facebook youtube. Camera is good, sound is good.

First of all I tell you the phone is very heavy and gives very uncomfortable feeling due to its weight and size. Sometimes it hangs while calling. The earphone jack stop also working partially now.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Yash Parashar,"It's indeed a good device, but for 19,499 quite expensive.",3,"Good device with a good processor. Battery life is no doubt a key feature of this device. Performance is also good, but there are better choices available in this price if you ok with those OS with multiple advertiand blotware. Camera is kind of ok, but personally I don't like it. So much noice in image. Don't forget there is no travel adapter in the box which cost me 1,249 from Samsung website. Rest choice is your, but if you are going for this device then I don't think you need to change for next 4-5 year's unless you want to."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sekhar,Deeply disappointed...,3,"Works like basic smartphone, I took this because of I believe in samsung for low radiation and os updates for 2 years.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amit Khot,Nice phone with fast charging but !,3,Overall good phone but I received my phone in which on the right side panel and the bottom panel of the phone has some scratches on it otherwise good phone... And it appears in some parts as if the screen is sticked by glue and if u order for replacement they send a technician or a inspection app so that u cannot return it and ask for a replacement for minor issues... If there are some scratches it wouldn't be a new phone and neither there would be the feelings of a new phone. Also the adapter we have to buy separately. Otherwise no problem with the phone
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Nishant Singh,Price for Samsung brand,3,Pros. 1. Relatively clean UI as compared to other android brands. Many Pre-installed apps are easy to uninstall. 2. Decent camera setup. 3. Decent battery ( Pls note I am not avid gamer) 4. Made in India 5. Knox security feature Cons: 1. Bit heavier 2. No s-amoled screen at this price range 3. No in the box charger (one need to speed 1149 extra on samsung fast charger). In box charger would have made it value for money. Recommendations: Who should buy- 1. Those who like Samsung UI and brand can buy. 2. Those who need disruption free internet while traveling and carry two SIMS

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Shivnath Karmakar,Camera Quality is not Good Enough!,3,"It looks like 16MP camera inside a 50MP camera. Picture quality is not good. No video stabilizer except one recording mode but the quality of stabilization is not enough, pixel density is not adequate as it is 50MP. I am somehow dissatisfied about the Camera performance. Screen would be AMOLED but given LCD. No doubt, it has premium looks, smooth and fast operations, good sound, long battery, and affordable."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Noodles,Gets heated up quickly.,3,"I use the og charger yet when I plug the phone gets hot. It's not very hot but noticeable. When I play a song with my earpods it's the same. Idk if it's just me or a common issue but I will check at the service centre one. The finger print reader fails you register prints, and with wet fingers it is a pain. The phone screen also gets affected by things like wires of a headphone, which is annoying sometimes but fine. Overall it's a decent phone, but I expected more. At least the thermals."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Akash,it is heating,3,"don't expect a lot guys, phone is ok ok. it is heating a lot i don't know why even though all i did was to se it up. amazon exchange was good and i got is for 15k. i think on paper it may look like good purchase, but it has no charger and it costs Rs 1000 for new samsung 25W charger. it is loot. if you get it less than 14500 then buy or go for other option. three star only because amazon was good, phone was fine but not as good as expected"

Keep this in your mind when you plan to buy this."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,shriram,Don't expected MUCH more from 33.,3,Battery backup is not good. It's not stand by not even a single day fully. After drain out it will take 2 hour's and 43 min to gain 85% by original 25 watts fast charger. By normal means it will take just 8 hour's only for 73%. Apart from that nothing big issues with this phone. Note ..... There is no charger with this phone. No lag in apadt 1 TB memory card. Camera parameters also okay. Smooth performance.....but we can't enjoy it because of these battery backup issues.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Reji,Call connecting issue after one year,2,"Actually the phone was feature loaded and I purchased it at 16k on nov2022. Phone was good in almost all aspects. But After one year it started giving call issues. When we dial a person - two rings and call dropped. After two or three attempts the other party calls back, two rings and call dropped. After some time without ring call drops. Then I will switch ON and then OFF flight mode, then it will work correctly for some time. In a day I have to on and off flight mode minimum 4-5 times. Then other people started complaining why are you not attending call, is your phone damaged, etc... Went to samsung authorised service. They said, there could be a problem with the COAXIAL CABLE. Leave the phone we will check. If it is not the problem then we have to change the MOTHERBOARD. 7-8K only... The place is far away for me, I needed the phone badly for my job. So didn't gave the phone. In a nearby repair store, I explained. He wanted the Phone in reset condition. The next day he gave the phone back and charged 2k, telling he replaced the 4g chip. It gave some good results but after some days the problem started again. I was afraid to spend more money in repairing it. So on 30.06.2024 I am ordering a NEW PHONE.. in just 1 year and 7 months.. SPENDING MY HARD EARNED. I can't imagine changing phone in 1.5 years, for i am a representative of the lower middle class.. A phone should run minimum 3 years. For that only I depeded on a famed brand.. If call option not working in a phone..what to say, phone is a must for my job.. Everyone from authorised service, local service and friends says M series of SAMSUNG is having this issue.. But I don't know how it still being sold in a higher price than I purchased.. And friends, Beware of the 'service centre replacement policy also' Thanks."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Dattaprasad Vaze,Only for elderly people,2,"Honest Review I bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience. It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy. I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience - 1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep. 2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better. 3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott. 4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area. The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad. Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition. The voice focus function is good. 5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location. 6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad. 7. There are some really small good features like samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers. 8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks. 9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger. The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move. Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and day. No charger"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,AM,Wow!,2,"The media could not be loaded. Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast. I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides. The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it! Edit: I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain. The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi). Edit: Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too. As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone. The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :( Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Doesn't support jio 5g,2,The mobile doesn't support 5g jio network.when contacted jio they said the same thing.where as product specification shows 5g compatibility
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sarthak jain,worst camera quality and less intelligent features than Redmi Phones.,2,"I bought this product because of its name Samsung. But I got cheated with this. I could not single pros of this phone rather than battery which of course a huge 5000mAh . Cons 1. Poor Camera Quality. Wide is worst. you will get blur images. Its camera give boost to my craving for an Iphone . 2. Poor features. you have to install third party app to see your daily data usage. otherwise you can't. I have a Redmi 5 which has a lot more features than this mobile. 3. Very heavy. It is heavier than similar sets with this range. 4. Average Display. If you are buying this, please add some 5000 extra for Amoled Display which is far far better than this cheap quality. 5. No charger. you have to buy charger separately which cost around 1200 Rs. . Redmi and other brands are giving charger plus screen guard with smartphone which is better than this . 6. Overall Experience is below average. It is not good enough as Expected. If you are buying your first phone please don't buy this one otherwise you will be felt cheated. Pros 1. It has very popular brand name . 2. .................... 3. ... ... . . . . . . . I don't think it has other than this. worst experience after Micromax."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,"Not a great phone, watch the specs carefully",2,"I used Samsung M30S for 4 years and bought this phone. It is a definitely a downgrade compared to the specs of M30S. Please read the specs carefully, so that you don't miss any information. Cons: 1. Screen is TFT and not Amoled or Super amoled. 2. Point 1 means this phone cannot support AOD( Always On Display) 3. Comes with good amount of bloatware and unwanted apps that you cannot uninstall. 4. I somehow feel this phone is slower than 4 year old M30S. 5. Does not have app lock. At least M30S had S secure. Now you have to depend on 3rd party app. 6. M30S had snooze notification or remove an app notification directly from tray which is missing in this phone. 7. Finger print reader is with power switch, that's not so great. Pros: 1. Camera is good and better than M30S. 2. Sound is good. 3. 5G support 4. Fast charging but this could still be better. Takes 1.45 hours for a full charge from 4%. 5. Has 3.5mm Jack for head phone. 6. Battery is good. With 6000mah."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,mantharamakrishna,Not satisfied,2,I am using Samsung mobiles from past 10 years but this was worst experience for me because from the first day Watsup calls will not get ring but after one or two minutes will get message that someone has called me even though done many settings. Second issue is that if I play songs continuously in headphones in any of the audio players after some time songs get stopped again I need to restart the songs. I thought that it was issue with headphones but I have changed new headphones issue is same

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Paramaguru,Worst product.,2,"I am using this for past 6 months and it is not to recommended. Working very slow - sometimes when i try to open any applications like camera, WhatsApp, etc. it took more than 4 second which is too ideal."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Mobile Network problem,2,"5G low network area mobile did not work incoming and outgoing problem. Battery, camera super"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Anonymous,"Excellent battery, light weight, absolutely worst camera, good processor with poor performance",2,"Pros: 1. More than 24hrs of battery life (Moderate use) 2. Light weight compared to the size of the battery capacity 3. Not too bulky to hold, one hand operation is possible for any normal size hand. 4. Superior processor (but wait) 5. Responsive screen 6. Good built quality, gives a premium feel. Cons. 1. Underperformance, 120hz refresh rate is just a gimmick, animations are just at par to 60hz screens. 2. Display has reddish tint. Colours are not as accurate. 3. Camera is the absolutely worst. Do not fall for '50MP QUAD camera setup'. It clicks pictures as equivalent to a 5MP camera. 4. Over smoothing out effect on picture ruins every click. 5. Over correction of colour in Camera, pictures look unnatural. 6. In low light condition, do not even bother to open the camera. 7. Too many bloatware both 1st &amp; 3rd party, took hours to debloat it. Final verdict: Spend few more bucks and get better phone or spend less and save some money, get a lower spec phone and replace every 2 years or so. PS: Still better than any other Chine*se companies (You know which are those)"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,mayank,Meh!,2,"Avoid!! Listing major cons. Too much cost cutting. Even after 7-8 months the phone still has bugs specially wifi mobile data bug where mobile data does not work after switching off wifi, you have to restart the phone. Ek bug khatam karte hai toh dusra aa jata hai. No auto brightness sensor, they use front camera gimmick to adjust brightness, but its a gimmick. No charger, company is saving so much money the box has is smaller, less cardboard cost, they can fit many more boxes in a truck again saving money, still they priced this phone at 20k. Storage is slow. UI is full of stupid bloatware and constantly prompt to sign in to samsung account, no way to disable all that non sense. Camera quality is also not good, I had realme prior to this and that had brilliant quality. You can get better phones in this range."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Shrikant Mishra,Please Don't Buy!,2,This phone is not very good. Within 7 months of usage the screen and the inner display panel have been corrupted nd broken w meagre falls for example the phone hit the edge of a table nd fell on the table as it slipped from my hands. The drop was about 20 cms and the phone screen as well as the inner display panel broke. Cost me about 3500 to repair. There are wayyyyy better options in this price range please consider those.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Alokendu,Handset made with old used material,2,"Not satisfactory! 1. It seem side panel is made with old used material.. Lots of scratches on side panel. 2. Though 5nm processor and 6000mAh battery, still battery draining fast . 3. Display quality is not good enough. TFT display. In this price you will get Amoled display in other brands 4. Performance not bad. 5. 120hz refresh rate working very smoothly. 6. Voice focus working smoothly. Giving 2 star rating because of the side panel made of used material with lots of scratches. Otherwise I would give 3 star rating. I will never buy a Samsung device again in mid segment."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Raghavendra,Poor build quality and an average product,2,This is my first Samsung smartphone and I have been an Mi fan since more than 6 years. I definitely regret buying this phone as the build quality is cheap. My Redmi Note 8 pro had a flawless and premium build quality. I didn't go for a new Mi phone because they didn't have any affordable phones with good feature in this price range. This phone is just average in performance. Also the display of this phone has a bad finish at the bottom and it looks like a refurbished product and doesn't feel like an original display. The whole display vibrates when music plays through the speakers even at low volume. Never expected Samsung to sell such poor quality phones.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Dinesh Thakur hp,Samsung M33,2,It's a nice phone under pocket friendly.... But charger is not in the box That's why it's a shameful decision for the company. Because it's not a expensive and more functional phone. So that's why it's a shameful decision for samsung... And so many other brands shows there charger for compitable for this phon. So the decision for choosing a charger is more hedecfull for a person....I have given only 2 star for this product in behalf of a charger
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,K,Good phone but without charger and headphone makes it a bad purchase,2,"Phone has great features but looks like to make the product price competitive, Samsung simply removed the charger head. I could had avoided my purchase had I observed carefully what is there in the box. On top of that, in order to cash on over fished customers, Samsung simply provided a cable which is Cat C head at both end so that the hapless customer cannot make use of other available USB chargers. Pathetic marketing. Apart from this I also observed that there is no screen guard pre applied to screen and now have to shelve out additional bucks for that too. Earlier I had Xiaomi, Lenovo and Realme phones and never saw such low kind of customer fishing approach. Thought to try with Korean Giant this time but seems caught unaware with this low level cost saving tactics at the cost of unaware customers. Phone is great but without the basic accessory and customer fishing marketing (of cat-c cable head at both end) simply ruined my shopping experience."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Anand,Buy this phone only when you get it under 12k,2,"This review I'm giving after using 1+year Battery is good , performance of the phone is getting slow with every New update even incoming and outgoing calls are taking too much time to get display over the phone Overall of you have budget issues and some how if you get this phone under 12k then only buy this phone otherwise looks for better option"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Femina Firoz,Network issue,2,Its a 5g phone but the reality is 5g doest not support. I didnt expect this much from samsung
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,RS,Average Phone,2,"Display is below average. Heats up while charging and more usage. Performance and Battery are good. Camera is okay. Body cover (backside of phone) is cheap. I believe one can find better option in other models or brands. I bought this one without much research as I've been buying Samsung in the past. However, with the latest models in Samsung in mid segment range, seems to be too much of cost cutting done now."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Harshad Shastri,Average phone. Heating issue. Very bad camera,2,I am writing this review after using this phone for 5 months. Pros - Fast charger Good display Good Screen ratio Multiple apps run without issues Good finishing Cons - Very bad camera heating issue while playing games and charging Screen guard breaks due to overheating Finger sensors are really poor Within 8 days it seemed very avg phone. Speaker is ok while playing Music but very poor during calls on speaker. Calling a person is pain. It takes 10 secs to appear an option to choose a sim to call for. Absolutely worst calling experience.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,dolly chaturvedi,Not recommended,2,I've been using this phn for last 2 years ...but I don't recommend to buy this phn ...first thing it's not light weighted ...it's very heavy to carry ....they didn't provide adapter with it ...I ordered adapter separately...working very slowly.camera quality also very bad
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Samsung irritates by pushing unnecessary apps like Moj,2,"Samsung has been pushing few apps being installed behind the software update, Samsung is forcefully installs these apps on our phone without our permission as part of their some deal with these app developers. This is really Annoying specially for elders who has no clue about this Battery life is good if you don't watch any videos, if you start watching videos battery will be drained in a hour or so Also basic feature like App Lock is missing (which comes in other android phones). I want to keep apps out of reach from kids, but seems there is no straight forward way for this"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,SONIA PRAKASH DESAI,Design flaw of finger print sensor - disappointing and annoying.,2,"Samsung M33 5G, side placement of finger print sensor is such a stupid design flaw that it keep on locking screen and you have to use PIN each time. 6000 mAH battery makes phone heavy weight and you have to grab the phone exactly on finger print sensor. This defective design is making quite disappointing experience. Do note that the phone does not get return/refund as this design issue is not considered as defect. Do check this issue before buying and putting your hard earn money as both Amezon and Seller do not respond to your query."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Bless,Phone sound is not audible. Screen flickers.,2,Samsung M33 is my second phone from Samsung. This phone has been giving me trouble in hearing phone calls due to poor voice. The screen display gets dimmed frequently. I have no time to run after SAMSUNG service center. Did I do mistake by buying this phone? Manufacturer inaccessible!
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,"Don't buy it, after 2 years of using motherboard damaged",2,"Don't buy it, after 2 years of used, bluetooth, wi-fi is not working, mother board issue."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,ANIRUDH MURALEEDHARAN,Ok phone,2,The phone is ok for normal use . i am getting battery back up form 7am to 9pm . while zoom call phone heat pretty high and battery goes down from 50%-10% in a hour. Day with out zoom call i will get backup 7am to 11:59 pm. as for now i am using 50% storage and not felt any lag on using it. yea opening camera app there it lag a bit. . also found a lag in switching data between networks. normal user its pretty good . daily heavy office use not recommended.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,No charger .mediocre phone,2,Shame on Samsung for not giving a charger at this price . will curse Samsung every time I charge it light Sensors also not showing up in sensors list Front camera is just 8 mp. Other than main rear camera rest are just gimmick n almost useless In 2022 they are still selling tft although quality is OK Phone is full of bloatware at startup but thankfully most are removable every now and then It heats up a bit even if no heavy task running In conclusion it's yet another overpriced average phone from Samsung
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Manish K.,4G runs faster than 5G..just for the name it's 5G,2,After using this phone since 6th Feb...I am truly disappointed with SAMSUNG..it's just a name now. Nothing fancy that you expect from SAMSUNG. 5G runs pretty low or no connectivity...network issues faced in my phone...why would I go to a service center after paying the full cost of the product...issues with calling incoming or outgoing whatsoever. My first phone from SAMSUNG proved me right that it's not worth spending you hard earned money. Highly Disappointed
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,I would not not recommend,2,"Camera was ok but not great, Battery life is good, but the reason why I would not recommend is exactly 1 year over the mobile CPU (RAM+ROM) Both are corrupted and I had to spent 4k, as a matter of fact I do not spent this much amount rather will go for new one."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Overall experience of Samsung M33,2,"I have used this phone for 10 days. It has started giving me display issues. Even phone gtts hanged for 2-3 second when i search on name in contact list. Since return period is over, I have to visit samsung store as i can't return this. Seems like samsung has compromised on hardware. I was a samsung fan but now have to think twice. My earlier samsung smartphone was A23. Quite good one."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Average,2,"Not value for money, Display and Camera Quality is very Bad cheap Quality"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,RAVI,Go for some other options,2,"#1 Camera quality is average #2 Doesn't feel like 120hz refresh rate more likely 60 #3 Battery is most disappointing draining at rate of almost 10% in an hour, and I have just used it for 4 days (no gaming, no GpS usage, no excessive streaming, not heavy apps usage) feels like using an old phone and u can imagine what will happen with 5g Sim 4 Don't know what cool technology they are using but it is heating up even with basic operations Don't buy this phone plenty of other better options available, brand is no longer trustworthy."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sudheer,internet detection is pathetic,2,"Sometimes my mobile data and wifi does not connect as soon as I switch on, I have to reboot. My mobile gets off when I am watching something on my mobile"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kedar,Mobile CPU damaged after one year purchased.,2,I had purchased Samsung M33 mobile phone through Amazon considering the reliability and durability of it's product but unfortunately my phone got damaged (initially started hang up) after once year of it's completion of warranty. Very disappointed by purchasing this product online.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ravinder,5G internet connectivity is very poor.,2,"Internet connectivity is very poor. Not expected this type of service from Samsung. Plz don't Buy. When Connected to 5G network, data incoming and outgoing Stop automatically ."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Himanshu Mishra,Not expected it to be like this,2,"Battery discharges pretty quickly as compared other new phones I have experienced before. From night till morning it loses 4% - 5% battery just like that with data in switched off mode. Also, I have removed all the apps which I don't use. In writing this review the battery has gone down by 1%. May be it is 6000 MAH that's why. Finger print reader is also very slow in reading and every now and then gives message cover complete sensor."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Bharath k,Missing many options,2,This phone doesn't have options to take screenshot otherthan pressing lock and vol down keys. The palm swipe option is not available. I even called samsung support regarding this and they said it'll be added in the next update but they did not. We can add only 3 finger prints. Camera quality is really poor. Battery backup is okay but not as expected.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Low performance,2,I am not satisfy with price. There are many problems with this handset like when we get whatsup we won't get caller name and other . Another draw back it is just 5G in name otherwise no good performance and also it get hang. So please do not buy it.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Karthik Kamath,Better to avoid,2,I bought this product for my mom who until now had been using a Moto G5 PLUS. Samsung has done an awful jon with the product. The build and all is okay but the phone hangs a lot and is slower than the Moto G5 plus which launched around 5 years ago.The battery backup is good but do note you don't get a charging brick with this phone and would have to spend another Rs 1200 to get a 25W charger. Disappointed in Samsung mid range phones. Best to avoid and go for a different brand.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Abhishek Jain,Complete disappointment,2,I found a big bug in this phone specially when u connected over wifi for an hour incomming and outgoing call gives no voice even on speaker too. This problem only will resolve by restart the phone. Which usually required to more than a 5 times in a day.phone is quite bigger and not able to handle by one hand also camwera quality is ok not good in this price range. Very disappointed
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Vivek,Display went blank after 3 days usage,2,"I just started using the phone from past 3 days and everything was good till evening. But all of a sudden, display has went blank even though I can feel the vibrations and hear receiving calls/message tones. Based on Google search results I am trying to sort out the issue from past few hours, but nothing helped me out. This is absolute shocker to me. Can I get immediate Customer Support here??"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Saikumar,Below average,2,Out of 8gb ram will get only 4gb free RAM which is worst experience. Poor rear camera quality. 16MP other phone camera works better than Samsung M33 5g. Front camera doesn't give good quality pictures. FHD+ screen quality is good and okay. Battery feels like its 5000 mAh. Fast charger is good. But Not super fast. Overall phone is below you're expectations. It's not a mid range phone. It's starting range phone with 5g chip. Don't expect too much before buying. Below average phone.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,It' heavy and comes without adapter,2,"It's too heavy and comes without adapter. Feels like using old generation Nokia 3310 handset, may be heavier than that I guess. If you charge using normal adapter, it would take more than 1 hour to charge and the 25 watt charger would cost &gt; 1400 unless you go for a cheaper one for which you would end up paying atleast 1000. Battery performance is fine, camera is average. Only thing I like was storage"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,suverna,Model has technical glitch,2,Bought this mobile based on past experience of Samsung but disappointed. Phone hangs when u get incoming calls (atleast 30% of calls u recieve) placed request to replace. Replaced handset was no better and now Amazon has denied to service it because there so called app minspect is not able to diagnose the issue and hence no defect proven. This will be my last handset of Samsung and last online purchase. Long live Samsung
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Not worth of price you pay...very poor display,2,Everything is good about the phone except display. Its a LCD display and not super AMOLED display. I was using M30s earlier which had super amoled dispaly and i had purchased it around 16k. I spent around 20k on M33 but display quality is very basic. If you are using amoled display phone currently and switch to this phone you will hate it.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Naveen (),Could have been better,2,"Sensor is not at the back but rather at side, adjacent to volume buttons and often fail to validate the right fingerprints. Calls sometime doesn't appear on screen or not highlighted. Quick responses are limited in no. of characters, expected at least 3 msgs length (this is required to send in non-english). Charge drain quicker than it is expected. Overall, would advise to purchase this mobile only if no other option."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,shankar krishnan,not what I thought,2,"Literally speaking apart from handset there is nothing in the box, even the packaging was pathetic. have just started using the phone, hope atleast the handset meets the expectations, cutting cost doesn't mean depriving the customer of his basic accessories. Samsung is just on the verge of becoming the next Nokia. Have been using samsung for the past 12 years, but if the same continues my next brand will not be a samsung phone"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Asfaan,Highly Disappointing Performance,2,"I am using Samsung M33 device over month now The device is really slow compair to my old redmi note 8 pro. Sometimes it gets stuck while I am using specially surffing Instagram, or calls. I was expecting a great performance from this device but it is really not worthy. I don't have any other choice then go back to my old device."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Vivek Pandey,Samsung is worst,2,As usual samsung phones have heating issues which is the biggest drawback and after using it for 10 days phones have lagging issues too.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kapil333,Videos not playing,2,"Bought a 8gb variant after going through the details minutely and was impressed by the specifications, but the happiness was short lived. Videos stop playing in the gallery and all video streaming apps like prime video, Netflix, hotstar etc.. Then have to force stop the gallery, clear cache and data of the gallery and restart time and again the entire day. Don't know what's the bug, although all apps have been updated and so is the OS.. #samsungindia pls advise"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Vagmaie M,Dissapointed purchase (Heating Problem),2,This is my First Mobile from Samsung ... and now I feel like I did a mistake in purchasing this product. 1. No Adapter .. Only C type cable is provide. We should buy a adopter which costs around 1200/-. 2. C Type cable is use less - Both the Ends are with 'C' Type. 3. Heating issue - Even after using for 5 minutes of whats App .. Mobile is generating lot of heat.. 4. Camera quality is poor.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,sounder,Battery is not good,2,Battery is not seems 6000 Mah. Even i fully charged it down with in a day. Camera is good but while taking video it stucks sometime. I don't prefer this product

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Malay Mitra,Cable doesn't fit any adapter,2,The media could not be loaded. - Both the sides of the cable provided are the same and seem to be meant for the phone. No side seems to fit any adapter that we have.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kunal,Why Samsung why ?,2,Doesn't it make sense for one of the largest phone manufacturers to pack the adapter 'if you are providing a new type of cable'. How do you expect customers to have power adapter for such cables ? Also no cover nothing. Is this Samsung? I am sure gonna stop recommending. Very DISSAPOINTED. Any features that comes to mind vanishes due to the lack of accessories given. It is mandatory to provide a costly item in a way so that it is usable for the customer.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Not satisfied,2,"Not satisfied with performance , slow processor , camera quality not good , For last 3 years I was using POCO F1 of xiomi , this Galaxy m33 is not even comparable with POCO F1 from any angle except price"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Binod Mahato,No voice during outgoing or incoming call.,2,I bought it in july 2022. 2 months it was ok. Since September I observed that there is no voice while dialing outgoing to incoming call. After restart the device it is working fine. After sometime same problem. Now a day it's frequently problem. Didn't expect such quality issue with Samsung device.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Nitesh G,3 week review. No Charger. Spend another 1000 bucks for it.,2,"Pros : High performance, lag free. average camera with some additional features. Dual sim with external memory card slot. Battery performance is good. Doesnt heats while gaming too. Inbuilt screen recording &amp; call recording. Cons : No charger. Sound is pathetic. Seems like a low-cost cellphone in sound output. Camera is of not premium quality given the price. Even with a 25w charger, the charging is slightly slow. TFT screen."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,5g network capacity down,2,I bought two new phone m33 and m14 and and I use same provide and same Sim but my m14 has always 5g network but m33 have some time I think should improve 5g capacity .
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ankur Batra,"Heating issues, too much lagging",2,"Heats up like a hot plate, too much lagging issues, phone dialer appears after 5-10 second, apps opening time is 10-16 seconds. 20k phone of samsung is not worth it. Money got wasted."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,tamasomajyotirgamaya,I wish I had not bought this,2,Very difficult to locate sensor.Also battery drains very fast without usage.My M31 is better even though it is more than two years old. Lastly you promised to send a technician who never bothered to come
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sovulraju,It's not samsung updated version,2,"Actually I need more battery backup it's not there and need to get fast charging it's not there what I expected it's not there in samsung33 so it's not updated version of samsung and it's get charging late consume battery power faster, i thing updated only 4g to 5g remaining all same."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kedar K.,No charger. This is ridiculous by Samsung,2,Its ridiculous samsung doesn't provide charger within the box. This is cheating. I got type c to c cable.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Mudit Pandit,There are many hidden problems in this phone.,1,"This phone is overpriced for even discounted price (12,999/- for 6 GB variant). I purchased it because of past good experience with Samsung (Galaxy On6) but this phone cannot match the legacy. Samsung has done too much unnecessary cost cutting on this phone. Camera: It has an average camera. It clicks decent photos and records good videos up to 4K 30fps, fhd 60. Only the main 50 MP sensor is usable, all others are present just for count. Camera has serious bug that it captures washed out colours if its AI detects a human face while using flash. If we remove human from frame, it captures just fine colours. Also, colours are just fine while clicking without flash. Front camera is pathetic from today's standard, it will just get you with video calls and nothing more, do not expect to use it for selfies with clarity. I do not click many pictures so I am okay with its camera. You can see this issue in the attached images, both the images were captured in low light with flash, the first one came out fine with colours close to actual object while the second one has completely washed out colours because the AI in phone detected human there. This unnecessary processing ruins the joy and there is no option in camera settings to turn this off. I have spent many hours trying to avoid this with different combinations of camera settings but it cannot be turned off. This bug might be embedded deep in the phone hardware as even third party camera apps ( I tried with OpenCamera) also give the same results. Battery : It can last for around 2 days with light to medium usage. It struggles to last one full day with high usage. Exynos 1280 is not efficient considering it is 5nm chipset. Also, the phone gets warm even with normal usage ( browsing etc) and gets somewhat hot during gaming. Idle battery drain is around 8-10% per night. It charges from 8% to 100% in 4:50 hours with 5 watt charger. With 7.5w (5v 1.5a) charger, it takes around 2:55 hours. Charges in around 2:15 hours with 15 watt charger (shows as fast charging). With 25 watt charger, the phone shows as super fast charging and charges from 5% to 100% in 1:24 hours. Display : Display seems smooth with 120 Hz, obviously not punchy as super amoled but it is okay and has good brightness for sunlight use and sufficiently low brightness for comfortable night use. Viewing angles are good. I did not face any issue with display and am okay with it. Buggy Auto brightness: Samsung has a habit of using cheap virtual sensors on its devices. This phone has virtual light sensors which is just a software solution to set screen brightness according to light present in room and using front camera as the light source. But this is seriously buggy in this phone, the phone does not understand difference between complete dark and dimly lit room. So, it will apply same brightness settings to both of these situations resulting unnecessarily bright screen in dark and uncomfortably dim screen in dimly lighted room. This sensor works poorly in outdoor as well. Most of the time, the brightness it applies to screen is not adequate. Software and UI: Samsung had installed may bloatware apps which are removable, One UI as everyone knows, is pretty user friendly. So, that is okay, however, Samsung should mention that this phone does not support some of the features such as S secure, bixby routines and sound assistant which are useful for some. Otherwise software experience is good, lag free. WiFi: It supports 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi at 1x1. So max of 72 mbps in 2.4 ghz mode and max 433 mbps in 5 ghz mode. This is the most basic wifi configuration possible. It can share wifi over hotspot which is nice. Although basic, wifi will not give any issue and has good range. So, wifi is okay. Bluetooth: I did not test bluetooth range but found it sufficient for my use. It can connect to two different devices simultaneously. However, can play music in one device only. Did not find any issue with bluetooth. Mobile network: It has good 5g support with 12 bands but supports only 1 5g sim at a time. If we set one of the sims to 5g mode, the other one drops to 4g/3g/2g mode. It supports carrier aggregation and when tested, it was working with 3 band carrier aggregation with Jio. Call clarity is good and it can record calls without announcing to other person. virtual proximity sensor is not too bad. Fingerprint reader: For this price, the performance of side mounted fingerprint reader is good enough. We can register up to 3 fingerprints only which is limiting and not appreciated, at least 5 should be given. Face unlock: I guess it has AI based face unlock which works good even in low light condition. Although I do not know how secure it is. Storage and Memory: It has 6 to 8 GB of Lpddr4x RAM which is good for this price. 128 GB storage used is UFS 2.1 which is not justified at this price in 2022 and lacks in performance when compared to UFS 2.2, apps take more time to install. Gaming: I installed call of duty mobile and it allowed settings up to medium graphics with very high frame rate and low graphics with max frame rate. In both settings, game was lag free and frame rate was always below 60 fps. So below average gaming. However, I do not play games, so, did not test with other games and do not care about gaming performance. Multimedia: Display quality is okay and single bottom firing speaker is average and audio from headset jack is fine, no complaints here. The chipset used in this phone supports h.264, h.265 video codecs only and does not support VP9 and AV1 codecs which is the most annoying downside. This means that it can play youtube only till 1080p and not in 2k or 4k because youtube supports h.264 up to 1080p only and we need vp9 and av1 support if we want to play higher resolution videos and if in future youtube removes h.264 support then this phone will not be able to play youtube at all. This is a very serious issue with this device. In future, all the streaming services will eventually switch to vp9 and av1 codecs as they provide better streaming efficiency and are royalty free, but as this phone does not support those, we cannot say this will be good for multimedia in future. So, 0 points for this in multimedia. Also, if we play youtube videos in browser like brave, it runs in software acceleration mode ( again, due to lack of vp9 and av1 capability) which loads up cpu and drains battery fast. Use youtube in either Youtube app or Newpipe to prevent unnecessary battery drain (as these apps play videos with hardware acceleration, which saves power). All this nonsense applies to other OTT apps (Hotstar, Prime etc) as well as almost all of them use VP9 codec for streaming which this phone plays in software mode, which shoot up the cpu usage and causes fast battery drain ( around 15-18% per hour). GPS and navigation : Works just fine. Has compass support. Pros: Two promised android updates and 4 years of security updates. Sufficiently good display with high refresh rate, feels really smooth. Good audio, WiFi and Bluetooth. dedicated memory card slot. base variant with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage which is good. Cons: Samsung cheaping out with no charger/cover/screen protector in box while competitors provide those. 5g on single sim only. Competitors provide dual 5g in even cheaper phones. inferior UFS 2.1 storage is not good at this price, UFS 2.2 should be there. only up to 3 fingerprints. Buggy camera algorithm. cheap virtual proximity sensor. buggy camera light sensor. Exynos 1280 chipset claims to be having 5nm lithography which is good on paper, but in reality, its efficiency is on par with some 12-14 nm chipset and it heats under general use. Also, I don't understand why Samsung had to omit useful VP9 and AV1 codec which wouldn't even have costed them more as they are royalty free and Mediatek Dimensity 920 with same Mali G68 GPU supports those codecs. This has resulted the phone to be not able to play 4K and 2K resolutions on youtube. No HDR playback support."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,VISHAL BALDANIYA,All Samsung Phones Are Worst Products,1,"It's been only two years, everything was working fine but phone suddenly restarts frequently without any reason. Showed it to service center and they told that there is an issue in mother board and it will cost rs.12000 to change it. I have also heard from many of my contacts that it is a common issue in Samsung Phones. Please never buy any Samsung Phones."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,AmazonCustomer,Worst possible phone at this price segment,1,"Please see screenshots. Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1. Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery. Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones. Camera: at low light does not identify objects well. Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display. Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking. Will add updates if I find any after few weeks. Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight. Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted. Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone. Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Nelson Winfred,The Phone exactly lasted 1 year and 1 month. Not worth to buy.,1,"(This is my very first Negative review in Amazon) I brought this mobile a year and a month ago. screen went blurry and vertical line appeared yesterday afternoon when i took my phone to check the time. after 1.30 hrs, it went completely off. in middle of the 1.30 hours i tried Factory reset. didnt help at all. (no exterior physical damage of any kind, used the phone as soft as i can. no scratches of any kind anywhere over the phone). This is my very first samsung phone i brought after one of my friend's suggestion. and it exactly lasted 1 year and 1 month. (Warranty is expired a month ago, just now i checked). Worst experience."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Himanshu Gupta,"Worst phone ever, motherboard defective",1,"This is the worst phone ever that I've bought. In 2023 after the software update it started heating a lot and in few hours it started restarting automatically endlessly. When went to samsung service center, they mentioned that it is a regular issue with M series phones that their motherboard will be dead after the update and same was told by many other local repair shopkeepers. Now, the phone is completely dead after 1.5 days when the issue started. As solution they offered me to replace the motherboard for approx. 8000 and was offering only 3 months of warranty. Such a pathetic phone and after sale service by Samsung. My request is do not buy M series phones from Samsung."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,dhananjay,Mother board,1,The mother board of cell phone got damaged within 8 months of purchase. The hardware quality could be more better.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Jai,Call recording does not work when WIFI calling is enabled,1,"I only bought Samsung for this particular feature ie, Call recording without the second party not getting to know I am recording the call. After the Android 11 release, every other phone company using Google dialer has to mandatory announce the call recording is in progress to comply with the GDPR laws of Europe. Only Samsung makes their dialers and does not use Google dialers by default, so they somehow circumvent this issue. But they did half-assed work. WIFI calling is an essential feature in the new phones. The network inside the homes is terrible in cities due to tower shortages. But when you enable the WIFI calling, this phone does not record, not manually nor automatically. Never knew this problem existed; even my old Oppo A31(android 9) has this call recording feature even if the WIFI calling is enabled. All Samsung phones, including this one, do not work. The Samsung forums have people complaining about this issue for the past two years, and still, there is no workaround from Samsung. I did not know about this problem. Otherwise, I would not have gone with this phone. Another issue, as everyone complained, is the missing adapter. It looks like Samsung wants to fool Indians by selling phones without adapters. I got fooled. It is going to give a bad reputation to Samsung. How good is a phone without an adapter? It's like buying a car without wheels. The phone is super heavy. It's not suitable for people with weak hands and muscular issues. Good as a hands-on weapon. Even though call recording has a severe shortcoming, the quality is good. It can be used as an everyday working phone with sufficient memory and storage."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Cirhan,Worst quality phone,1,"I am extremely disappointed with this phone. After only 1.5 years of use, the phone suddenly stopped working. I took it to get repaired and the technician said that the CPU is burnt. I tried to get it repaired a couple of times but to no use. The component quality is the worst. This has been my worst experience with a Samsung product. This is by far the worst phone Samsung has ever made. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this phone at all costs."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Anand Kumar,Absolute Nightmare - Samsung Galaxy M33 5G is a Total Disaster!,1,"Don't buy it for your parents! Unless they know how to fix the baseband chips. I am utterly disgusted with my recent purchase of the Samsung Galaxy M33 5G. This so-called 'smartphone' has proven to be nothing more than a waste of money and an endless source of frustration. The most infuriating issue I've encountered is the phone's absurd behavior when the screen locks. When the screen is locked, the Samsung Galaxy M33 5G magically loses its carrier signal. So, forget about receiving any incoming calls, because your supposedly advanced smartphone is now nothing more than a glorified paperweight. Initially, I thought it was a network problem, But no! It turns out that this phone is just junk. This phone is a scam! It acts like it's a normal device, but it's a disaster waiting to happen. Amazon/this seller should be ashamed for selling such a faulty piece of junk. Total deception, total disappointment. I am not sure if it is the seller or the mobile. Do yourself a favor and save your hard-earned money. Steer clear of buying this product here unless you enjoy the thrill of not being able to make or receive calls, having a non-responsive device, and flushing your money down the drain."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Aj,Waste of money,1,"First ever 5g phone from samsung which has developed many issues after updates some of them which are charger not compatible after update, usb connect disconnect issues, usb not connected via pc,intially finger print went away, then vibrator It seems the phone doesnt support software updates"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Not satisfied,1,Worst product after warrenty period charging issue
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Hi..! I am Pranav,Don't buy.. Too much Heating Issue.,1,"Overall this mobile is good in manner of Look, Shape, Colour, Display, Rear Camera (Only Rear not Front one), But, there is too much heating issue. As soon as you unlock the mobile it's starts heating, only even if you are just rolling the screens and apps. While downloading apps, and updating apps temperature increased around 39C. (Checked my Amazon customer care online with the help of temperature measuring app, when I called them regarding this issue). Battery also gets drained very fast, front camera is useless also use, not a good quality camera. Don't buy this mobile even if you are getting it in less price in offers.. Returned this mobile and aslo got refund in time. I Really liked the service of Amazon.. Customer care executives are aslo very supportive. Thanks to Amazon team who helped me in this issue, thanks for cooperation and support. It was great experience. Just a request please remove this Mobile from your websit. And before allowing to sale any mobiles please check the quality of the all mobiles so that no any other customers will face such problems which I had faced. Thank you. (Note: Request to Amazon team - Don't hide my review/feedback as it's negative review. Customer must know about the issue with this mobile. Don't show only good reviews by hiding the bad, negative reviews and don't fool the customers.. )"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ashutosh Kumar Tiwari,One of the worst phone I have bought ever.,1,"One of the worst phone I have bought ever. Within a year the trouble started, it was getting power off frequently after operating sometimes and the service provided by Samsung care was worst as well. I have visited Samsung Care many times for this issue but they did nothing. The issue still persist."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Krishna Ravi,Battery does not last even half a day,1,"Please be aware of buying Samsung mobiles. They are no more of quality they used to. I tried Samsung M33 Galaxy before. After 2 years after completing a software update the phone started heating and shutting down by itself. As an engineer I fail to understand how a software update can cause hardware failure. I tried to rectify the problem and the company quoted nearly 50% of the phone cost. I believe it was deliberately caused by the company. I started using an old vivo phone since which was damaged in an accident and had to buy a new phone. I ordered for another Galaxy M33 as i used to get better pictures with it. Unfortunately, the battery of the new phone does not last even half a day. I have to charge more than 2-3 times in the day. I was prejudiced against China brands but after my repeated experience with Samsung and the China brands I am convinced that Samsung is more the company it used to be in terms quality. It has lost all business ethics and is resorting to deceitful means to survive."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Gourishankar p.,The processor is garbage!!!,1,Pleasee if you concern about the performance then please don't buy this phone. The laptop seriously sucks! I don't know why samsung makes this garbage processor.

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ashu,"Battery not up to the mark, apps don't remain in the memory",1,"With only normal browsing and YouTube not even giving full one day backup. Was using moto phones before this with 3000 mah battery and it is giving similar backup. Also frame drop in BGMI is on the higher side. You will not be able to play the game. M21 is much better option even for the same price. Also no option to disable Ram plus. 120 Hz seems to be only marketing gimmick. Only thing which is in favour is 2+4 years of update. That will also time tell. Edit Updating the review after using for almost 1 month. Phone was never fast but now after one month performance has degraded even more. Phone has serious issue with multi tasking. You are listing music and at the same time let's say you opened some app, you will notice lag in the music while the app is opening. In some places you can't use you installed keyboard and have to work with samsung keyboard. Even after phone update and bgmi update, still have to use the smooth high, phones at 10k can run the game in better settings. Even basic tasks like dialler still takes 5-6 seconds to load, both when calling/receiving. Working on ms teams or outlook is a nightmare in this phone as it takes it's own time to perform the tasks. Overall very very slow phone. Not at all recommended."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Durai Murugan,Don't buy this model,1,This phone is not good in receiving Mobile network signal strength. If you are in vowifi it frequently changed to Mobile network. Hotspot sync issue is there. Pls don't buy this model...
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amandeep,Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,1,"This is my first ever samsung mobile. Unfortunately samsung lived upto it's negative publicity of allowing limited features. Android 12 is not fully optimised to it's potential, only 1 or 2 gestures provided. Only WhatsApp is showing as dual app no other app. I WAS USING MORE APPS ON MY REALME 2PRO IN DUAL APP SETUP. BATTERY MANAGEMENT IS OK BUT IF YOU ARE NOT USING PHONE BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY GOOD. DISPLAY IS ALSO GOOD AND COLORS ARE GOOD. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE NOT GOOD FOR A PHONE PRICED AT 25K. I AM EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH THE CHEAP MARKETING GIMMICKS BEING PLAYED BY SAMSUNG INDIA. 1. NOT PROVIDING ADAPTER , ONE HAS TO PURCHASE SEPARATELY. 2. SAMSUNG WAS OFFERING FREE AFAPTER AS GIFT ON ITS OWN SAMSUNG ESHOP APP AND WEBSITE DURING FAB FEST IF PURCHSED DIRECTLY FROM THERE ALONG WITH CREDIT CARD DISCOUNT. 3. NOW SAMSUNG HAS LAUNCHED THIS PHONE WITH A NEW COLOUR AND I LIKE THIS NEW COLOUR BUT I HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED GREEN WITH 8 GM 128 CONFIG. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR LAST ALMOST 10 DAYS AND FOUND FEW CONS: PHONE IS HEATING WHILE CHARGING. PHONE HANGS IN BETWEEN. PHONE DIALER IS SLOW, ONE HAS TO WAIT FOR CALL TO GET DIALED AFTER CLIXKING TAKES ALMOST 3-5 SECONDS. WONT RECOMMEND this phone to anyone."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Bhanupriya Gairola,Don't buy this phone- technical issues,1,"The media could not be loaded. Within a year, my phone's motherboard is corrupted and now all my data in the phone will be lost while replacing the motherboard. Worst phone- technical problems and issues like over-heating. Please don't buy this phone if you want to use a phone to its fullest. It will die in a year or so. It happened with me that one day I was using my camera on whatsapp and suddenly the screen went blank and then started restart process which didn't turn on the phone instead it got stuck in a loop and only the first boot screen was there. I hope samsung improves their products. This is totally a waste of money- 20k for a phone which works for a year and then dies a sudden death and takes with it all your data which you can't have back."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Mayank S.,Worst device total waste of money,1,"Don't go for low range samsung devices, heavy lag issues accompanied by lots of defects. Mobile died in 1.5 years only"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,VK,Phone is pathetically slow.,1,"Have been using phone for last 3 days. So far so good. It's running very smooth. Battery backup is decent. Kudos to Amazon and delivery boy who delivered it at almost exact time as mentioned on the order. Phone deserves atleast 4 stars but I have deducted 1 star because of hypocrisy of Samsung. They are not providing charger citing the reason to save the environment while at the same time forcing buyers to purchase it separately. So, dear Samsung team, please let us know how does it affects the environment less when we are purchasing the charger separately and a delivery boy is burning fuel, seller wasting another piece of paper for packaging to deliver it separately instead of delivering it along the phone itself. So, please save the image of environment saviour, that you want to portray yourself, for some other promotional event. After few months usage, decreasing the stars to 1. Lots of space still available on phone but it's pathetically slow. Keeps on lagging with minimal usage. Read somewhere it's because of type of storage samsung is using in this phone, not sure though. It takes a lot of time in opening any app, sending msg on WhatsApp. From past few days, it gets restarted randomly on any screen. Worst mobile purchase till date for me."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Sagar Sawant,M33 5g battery drain n heating,1,I bought M33 5g. But the phone heats on simple scrolling while reading web pages This inspite of turning off 120hz mode Samsung needs to urgently check this. Two hours of reading and scrolling drained off 25% of battery while my 4 year old Redmi Note5 doesn't heat or drain battery so fast for same amount of activity. I also had MI max2 whose battery lasted almost 3 days This phone battery inspite of being bigger lasts at max 1.25 days Phone has special cooling tech and processor is 5nm but still heating issues Camera even if u turn landscape clicks photos in potrait ... takes lot of time to detect orientation or does not derect orientation 18000 phone does not have procimity sensor n light sensor They use camera for it and its worst ... does not adjust screen brightness properly and takes lot of time to do it or even forgets to adjust it auto ... u have to do it manually Phone should have been priced 15000/- at max or at least AMOLED screen should have been given HEATING ISSUES FOR SIMPLE SD VIDEOS VIEWING OR SCROLLING WHILE READING THEIR COOLING TECHNOLOGY LOOKS TOTALLY CRAP Moto G52 5g looks better in comparison
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Dr Baahu,Average performer,1,"Recommended for house wives and mothers who use phone moderately (i mean, this phone is not good for heavy users). Reason for 2 star rating is that they didn't provide a charger and with the charger which i got separately outside, I'm facing slow charging speed and heating issues. Mobile company giants like samsung and apple are not providing chargers in the name of becoming ECO FRIENDLY, but doing this only adds to carbon footprint by these : 1]new charger means new cover and new box for that charger 2] additional new box and packaging material for shipping (@ online orders) 3] additional fuel consumption by vehicles transporting the charger 4]additional invoice means additional paper 5] if the received piece is defective or not upto the mark, returns and replacements add more to all these. THIS BETTER STOP NOW. this new trend is as annoying as it's impracticality. If not for their charger feud, i would've given this 4-5 stars. PS: display is a drawback for this mobile but in the long run, you wouldn't notice any difference. So, i guess LCD display isn't much of a problem."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,ananth,Network issues observed,1,The media could not be loaded. 1. Phone has serious network issue. 2. It often shows 'Refreshing SIM Data ' and the network in second SIM slot is gone. 3. When this happens the Monile network data does not work. 4. Putting the phone into Aeroplane mode and putting it into Normal back also does not solve the issue. 5. Final option is to restart. 6. After restarting it's same for some time (1st SIM no Mobile data and 2nd SIM does not detect). 7. After quiet a long time Mobile data is back but 2nd SIM still has the problem.. 8. 2nd SIM detects in it's ownnnnn time Used the phone only for a week. For others who think Mobile data was not available at my location = my other phone with Same Vodafone network works perfectly
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Horrible battery,1,"Writing this review after using the phone for 6 months. Initially it was good.But after there was a software update for 5G, the phone showed its true colours. The battery lasts for merely a day, with a very low usage of the phone. if i use Maps/ Uber/ Twitter or other heavy applications, the fully charged battery lasts for few hrs only. (yes - 5-6 hrs only) Camera quality is pathetic to say the least - grainy photos. the Samsung store has an unrestricted access to the net, hence it always keeps on updating one or the other Samsung apps. For other apps, i can restrict the battery usage, but for the Samsung apps, i cannot restrict the battery usage. Unable to delete/ uninstall any of the samsung apps. Many more such nuisances are present in this phone. I had bought this phone to oppose Made in china phones, but i feel i did a mistake. i dont think i will ever go to Samsung again."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Tinku Tharasing,Worst and laggy phone i ever used in my life. Also Samsung site got better rate than this,1,I made purchase then noticed 2k less on Samsung website. Anyway its my mistake so not returning it. Hope this will be fast one as its 6gb ram. After couple of days usage i am feeling bad on this purcgase. 6GB ram but i am not happy with speed of this. Skype too slow. 4 cameras but its useless for taking photos of real use. If you just want to share it on social media then it looks awesome. But if i want to take a product photo and try to edit in photoshop its no where near to usable quality As its slow you definitely need tripod to get photos proper. Usage review It's the worst phone i ever used and 6gb or 8gb ram is just a trap. It's useless as this phone is dead slow. If I click something i get something else. That kind of slow it is. Chinese brands with 2gb ram and below 8k budget got 100x speed than this. To type this review it took me lot of time becaus it's issues.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Waste of money,1,"The media could not be loaded. Cons Mobile hangs at times. WhatsApp misbehaves often, if any calls in WhatsApp call disconnects even after updating the app and mobile software. Camera is not that great. Bought 3months ago in EMI but am trying to exchange this mobile or even sell this phone because unable to use WhatsApp. Reporting my team during office hours becomes highly irritating. Pros: Sound outcome is good. Music plays loud. I wana change this product, amazon please change it."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Tarun Kumar Sharma,Not worth it...,1,"I had a realme 1 before I bought this phone. I used it for about 5 years and was quite happy with it. The battery still had a lot of juice in it even after t years of use. The resolution of the screen was fantastic. It was thin and light. The only reason I had to change it was because it had slowed due to the old processor. Compared to this M33 is bulky that makes it difficult to handle. There are a lot of bugs in the phone. Sometimes the phone freezes while working. Sometimes the touch fails to respond, the Bluetooth has a mind of its own and seldom connects automatically with paired devices. The screen resolution is not too great. Often the phone slows down. The screen is not not as good as in my previous phone. This is the last time I m buying a samsung."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Raghav,Very worst product,1,"The performance is very poor. Ram management is very bad. Battery drains very quickly and it doesn't perform like 6000mah. Travel Adapter is not included in the box. If the travel adapter is not included they should want to give some discount to purchase the new adapter for the M33 5g buyers right, but they are not giving. I have contacted both Amazon and Samsung regarding discount for adapter who purchased M33 5g device and they are not ready to reduce 1 Rupees from MRP. This phone is not worth for 17k. I'm very disappointed. Thank you Amazon and Samsung for this worst phone. And the final part is, in the invoice the IMEI number is not mentioned. Without IMEI number, I don't know how can I claim the Warranty. I have checked with Amazon customer support but they are useless and not helping in this issue. I have contacted Samsung support they said, Without IMEI number warranty claim is not possible. Finally I felt that even i purchased the Chinese mobile i will have warranty for 1 year.. very verst worst service."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,GG,This is NOT what SAMSUNG stands for,1,"I am a loyal Samsung Mobile user with all 4 adults in my family using SAMSUNG devices. And our experience with Samsung was great UNTIL NOW. M33 5G is a bundle of endless pains and problems, like: * Slow response time, so STAY AWAY FROM EXYNOS PROCESSORS * Below average camera (foggy images) and screen resolution (compared to even phones from Chinese brands costing 25% lower than M33 5G) * Keeps losing mobile network, Wi-Fi calling needs to be reset every couple of hours and hotspot for some reason practically doesn't work * Lower than expected battery backup - 2 hours in a VC and it starts huffing and puffing In summary, I will need to replace this phone in a few months, and I will still go for a Samsung one more time hoping that my next device takes behind my earlier Samsung phones and not the current one i.e. M33 5G."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,3rd class product,1,"In every 6 months needs to change the charging IC very worst product by samsung. Very irritated by this product, it's waste of money and not customer satisfied."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Anand chavan,Worst product ever seen.,1,"Worst product ever seen. In one week mother board problem detected. Given in service center for replacement. Samsung did not replaced it, they gave me samsung coupons of my mobile value I.e. 17999 Rs. This coupon you can not redeem online. To redeem this coupon you have to visit local samsung gallary. Local samsung gallary did not deal in M series. They forced me to buy A series. For same specification of MSeries , I have to pay 6000 Rs. More. Samsung customer care also did not supported me in this issue. I did not use mobile for a week and I have to pay 6000 Rs extra for mobile. Dont buy Samsung phone they are looting to customers. Even call center guy told ne that you purchased mobile from Amazon so you are facing this issue. If you purchased it from local market you will never face this issue. So i request u guys dont buy Samsung phones and if you want to buy it, dont buy it from amazon."

Now that 5G is enabled by Airtel in Chennai, I changed the setting to 5G but it is not working at all. When I contacted Samsung customer service, the agent informed that there is some technical issue with M33 5G phone and Samsung technical team is working on the same. They still did not identify what is the issue and how to fix this issue. It is not just M33 5G model having the issue, agent read out long list of Samsung 5G models having this technical issue. There is NIL communication from Samsung about this technical issue and they are taking customers for granted. I am disappointment and extremely unhappy with the Samsung."

It was automatically updated the OS after that there is a line in disply. We have warrenty as well. When I check with Samsung service center. They said it will not claim in Warrenty.

Camera is a tragedy.... a 5000Rs camera phone is far better than this.... I was cheated by this product both my manufacturer and seller. There is no return for me soo i m still sufferring with this mobile. Battery is 5830 mah which looks like normal 5000 mah as it comes only 1 day with wifi usage. Its 5G supported , but it not shows 5 G for me eventhough im a Airtel Bangalore Customer. It shows as 4G+ No adapter, Samsung cheat you by giving a type-C to type-C cable not USB one ..."

But been having problems with payment apps and office apps. Upon digging/Googling I understood that it is because messaging doesn't work on M series phones. We cannot save the messaging centre manually, and it is probably a bug. I tried calling Samsung Customer, I am hoping I will get a call back from them in a couple of hours and hopefully a fix. Truly truly disappointed, not what I expected from a 20000+ phone. Update: Got a callback next day from Samsung, they want me to do a bunch of trouble shooting steps. If those don't work, I am to go to the nearest service centre. Please be wary before buying this phone."

My phone lags every now and then. Battery is medium.I Don't quite understand why a 6000 mah battery run so less!! Samsung must have compromised with quality here. Processor is also unable to handle simple tasks. It is definitely not a gaming phone. U can't even play normal games. Camera is more than bad. Front camera is worse. It's just a 5g phone. Nothing else. There are better options available out there.

But this phone has lots of bugs, basic navigation is buggy. Keyboard swipe to write is buggy. Sometimes on unlocking it hangs also. At last its all the same whether you buy a redmi phone or samsung phone. So why spend more money on this phone buy some other phone. It has features but they dont work as expected."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,"Over priced, low quality phone",1,"Phone is of low build quality, it performs very slow compare to my existing poco M2 6gb 128gb. Lags in very action scrolling, app search. Display is of very bad quality, very bad contrast poco M2 has better display. Or any phone with IPS display would feel better than this. Waste of money. Collects lot of data and no way to stop. Phone do not start until you their samsung conditions. After buying either you throw your phone or accept their conditions. Very unethical company. 5200mb ram for 6gb whereas poco M2 has 5800mb ram. I am first and last time buyer of samsung. Would have brought poco m4 5g instead of this. Lot of background samsung services keep running and cannot stop them without root."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,ROHIT MONGA,NO CHARGER !!! NO CABLE !!! HOW DO WE CHARGE OUR PHONE,1,"What is this, Samsung provides me only mobile phone, NO charger NO cable what is this? Every appliance every gadget provides basic accessory. Even you buy a Chinese electric toy car. They will also provide you charger. But Samsung is providing you phone with cost of rs. 20000 without charger. Ots totally unexpected. You will have to pay rs. 1700 for adaptor and rs. 600 for cable and rs. 400 For plain silicon back cover means phone total price is rs. 22700. But you can easily buy better 5g mobile with charger cable backcover along with 8GB RAM 128 GB Internal Memory @ rs. 18000-19000. So think before purchase"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon User,Very slow processor!,1,"Due to extremely slow processor and poor RAM management, multitasking is difficult. It takes time to respond when switching on, or unlocking. Overall, the phone is quite slow. The only good thing is battery life."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Hari,Fake warranty,1,"I bought this product on sep 22. At the time of purchase amazon said it came with a 1year warranty. When i approached Samsung with an issue with the display during June 23, they have informed that the warranty expires in June. It seems, Amazon has sold me an already used product. This is not proper business ethics by amazon. I am being sold a faulty product and being denied proper warranty"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,abdul,Poor battery and processor,1,After use of 3 days. Battery very weak. In 2 hours it goes down. Screen becomes black sometime. Sometime apps like hotstar or Netflix behaves abnormally as touch will not work.not sure it's app issue or phone issue. Processing is poor. Not good phone in 20k range. Samsung phone are loosing quality. This is second phone I am facing issue the earlier was Samsung M31s whose motherboard died in 18 months. Of 20-25k you cannot give good phone then Samsung should stop builting phones. Adding some more : Either you are using fast charger or slow there is hardly difference: For fast charger 3 hours total time to complete charging. For slow charger 3 hours 15 to 20 min.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,santosh kumar sinha,Dabba phone,1,"It is a dabba phone. Every now and then, it keeps losing internet connection (both wifi and mobile network). Selecting/deselecting wifi and mobile data does not help at all. Only option left is to restart the device. I have to do it almost 5-6 times a day. So frustrating it is. I took technical support as well but that too did not work. My recommendation is NOT to buy this device. AVOID."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Tripti jain,Charger must be there,1,"*This is for samsung!!* Haven't used the phone till now, but Whats the issue with providing charger. Already paying good price for phones, then they don't even provide complete package. In case of this particular phone, They have provided cable. This cable has C type ports on both the sides, which means you can't use other adapters you already have.. And ultimately phone is unusable unless you buy a new adapter which comes around Rs 1000. Why these companies are moving towards this? Imagine buying laptop without charger, you are forced to pay more for the items, which are inherent part of the main product.. Charger should be there in package."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ramesh,Not upto the expected level of performance,1,"I was using a oppo f11pro. Comparing with that I didn't see any feature which is more comfortable. Camera _it's average, Screenshot _not user friendly, Sound quality _better. When you dial a number,it takes irritating 4secs to get to the dialling screen...Its is taking almost 3hrs for full charging of battery...And moreover, you have to buy a charger separately (i think its the same for most of the phones now)..You dont get an inbuilt music player. You have to download a music player separately and you have to bear all those unwanted ads too....After 11years i bought a samsung mobile..But now i regret my decision...I don't recommend samsung m33..."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Azhagu,Worst product and service,1,"Worst product, mobile is not charging and battery is draining very fast. I have booked appointment for mobile inspection. Next day person named Mahadevan (mobile inspection service) called and asked for OTP and said he will give other mobile on friday. On friday when i called he hasent picking the call and even blocked my Mobile number. Poor response from these irresponsible service people"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,shrikant pareek,Worst Warranty Service,1,"The Mobile was dead suddenly and I was not able to switch jt on it. When i opt for warranty service, the Company said there are scratches on screen hence it's out of warranty service however there were no scratches on the screen. No boday was cooperating from the Samsung side and they don't care about customerat all. If mobile is sold thereafter they won't take any responsibility for this. Thereafter I told them to repair on chargeble basis so they asked me repair charges more than the mobile cost. I suggest everyone don't buy any mobile of samsung since the services are very poor."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Poor sound quality,1,"Did not like the cell phone quality. Amazon sent a professional who did agree that phone sound is not at par. Asked to reach out to Amazon. Amazon turned blind eye, we are stuck with a product we don't like. Better to buy cell phones from a local store. Stay away from Amazon.in at all costs. You're better off buying something from a local store by checking the quality. Amazon support was super rude, they will disconnect your call and say they are bound to disconnect the call. There is no escalation route. You're stuck with purchase with no option to return or replace with a better product."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Waste of money. Camera clarity is very bad,1,Don't waste money on this mobile brand. If you are not sure about the mobile specifications better visit nearest mobile store and check the different brands of mobiles. Then take a purchase there itself. I have wasted my money money. Because if there is any damage only we can able to return. For other issues they will not accept for returning the mobile. We have to adjust or exchange in nearest mobile store.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Aman,Type C to C Cable but No Adapter,1,"This is a genuine comment just after unboxing - I went on to charge the phone and I discovered they gave a Type C to C cable and that too without the adapter !! After providing a Type C to C cable which can't be connected to any USB adaptor, They could have atleast provided an adapter with it. This is just intolerable, now I need to run somewhere to buy a Type C adapter. Charge a little extra price but atleast provide an adaptor in the box !!"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Dharmendra Gupta,Worst phone,1,"Too much heating after 1 hour use.. Camera Quality not upto mark as per mentioned Phone comes 6+128GB mode but when you open that phone out of 128 GB storage phone takes 30GB and out of 6 Gb ram phone takes 2.5GB for their internal process. Even Ram plus working as per description... Phone getting hang if you continually use 2-3 hours watching movies/Web series.. Phone heated and hang too much, so you can't play games for long time. Phone will be work if you have only basic use like calling, SMS and Social media chats"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Praveen Charles A,Mobile IC fault,1,After 2 years the mobile is getting switched off automatically. IC failure. I never had this issue with Motorala or any other brands. Worst mobile.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Mohaa,Defective Product screen Sucks & Over heats | very very Bulky |,1,"I've ordered this phone right on the first day of launch considering it to be a better version and upgraded specs than M31 which I am using from last 2 years. Cons and only Cons 1. Very very Bulky, feels like holding a slab of Granite in my hand 2. Overheats while charging and playing games 3. Despite they've provided LCD screen I guess that was in order to Save Battery, however the screen sucks. It's very low in Brightness unlike previous version of M31 4. Even the Camera is not Good. 5. 0 rating for size. 6. No charger despite paying 16k 7. Samsung installs unwanted applications everytime in your phone when you update 8. Worst Display in Samsung M series ever. 9. No travel Adapter Pros Colour is great UI is just Perfect, user delightful"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Placeholder,Samsung M33 5G. 8GB.128GB.Android version 14.(Deep otion blue) cost paid is rs16999/-,1,This is 2nd remainder for the above subject.i am sorry to say that when I have received the above product immediately I have opened the package and go through the phone and found the above details in tact.After some days I found tetanus are changed to as 6GB.128GB and android version 13.Hence replace the phone with the 8GB.128GB storage and android vertion14
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,sateesh neeradi,Worst Phone. My sincere advice is that don't buy this Product,1,"Worst Phone I have ever used. Phone heating like iron box. even MI phones are better in this context. Its better if we expect nothing from camera. They equipped it with 2 MP depth sensor but pics missing that depth feature. Main problem with this product is they are not accepting return. It is actually violation of customer right since they didnt even provided trouble shooting. They boast it as 6000mah battery but it not even withstanding for 16hrs of Normal use. I pray you all that don't buy this phone. You can have a better phone in this price range along with Charger, Screen Guard and Pouch."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,Still Overpriced.,1,"Because of the missing charger/adapter, unconventional type c to type c cable the overall cost of the product is much higher after considering what a new smartphone user gas to spend. Had samsung given an optional free adapter, we would have believed that Samsung actually wants to save the environment and not milk their fans. In my opinion the cost of the phone prior to any offers should be 13999. Also, the phone does get hot on the top right corner on the back. Moreover, you cannot record calls when wifi calling is enabled. This problem is something Samsung should address and publicly admit for transparency with the users."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kunal Kumar Rajak,Not waste your hard work money with this Cheap product.,1,I bought this product and just after warranty period . It creates charging issue. It doesn't take chage even i have samsung adapter and cable l. During 1 year It is good but after one year It servers various issues. Camera quality is also not good. Please don't buy. You money will get waste like me . All samsung phone have charging issues.
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ramanjaneya,"Please don't buy, it's big loss for me",1,"Im writing this review after using my phone Samsung M33 for 10 days. I never expected this worst camera quality from Samsung that too 50MP. Positive: Brand and Light weight Negatives: 1) No charging adapter 2) Camera quality 50MP quality not matching with Honor 9N 13+2 MP camera quality. 3) If you move little bit it will capture as blur, But I have not found this issue with Mi and Honor phones 4) Low light forget about taking picture. 5) sometime its becomes slow. I wonder being such great brand how they can release such products into market without testing their feature qualities."
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Rocky,Basics are totally missing,1,Disappointed with the Samsung Galaxy M33 5G. A smartphone without basic app lock facilities is a let down. Not expected from a brand like Samsung. Won't consider this company again until they get their basics right. #SamsungGalaxyM33 #CustomerFeedback
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Kindle Customer,Worst 5g smartphone at high price,1,"Worst smartphone by samsung, not a single strong point of this smartphone to be appreciated, only flaws are made, camera is descent, disply is LCD,which is very bad at 18-19k price range, 5g speed is good, but it heats up when network is at 5G speed, charger in the box is not included but have to spend extra 1200 on genuine charger, there are so many options in other brand, Don't buy this smartphone. Only box of 6.7 inches is made nothing optimised. Processor heats up a lot in outdoor conditions"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Amazon Customer,do NOT buy this phone,1,"I have now used this for almost 3 weeks now and I can confirm that this phone is NOT really worth it. I bought it after positive experience from my previous buy from this series the M31, what an awesome phone M31 is. but M335G is NOT good, camera is inferior to my M31 and the screen is also inferior, there is more bloatware which you cannot uninstall. Forced update installs more bloatware. beware of spyware included in this that installs 'recommended' apps without your consent. The phone is heavy. On the bright side, it is slightly faster than my M31, 120 refresh screen appears silk smooth (but not by that much) Worst of all, it does not come with charger nor earphones, strange omission at this price point."

Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Ajith Kumar KS,Missing Charging adapter in the package and defective charger cable,1,"Charger Adapter which is an essential accessory with any phone was missing and was not part of package. A clear mislead/cheat to show a reduced price. The charging cable that came with the package was defective and not usable, since both ends of the charger cable was C type. When there are no USB point, how can we connect it to any adapter or laptop to charge it. A clear disappointment from Samsung. You need to replace the charger cable Free of cost"
Samsung Galaxy M33 5G,Shree ganesh,Kyo Maine kharida ye phone,1,"Sunday ko deliver hua Hai aur Monday tak Mai pareshan ho gaya hua. ( 2 days review) Pros 1. Pata nahi Cons 1.

HP AMD Ryzen 5,Bijay Singh,Good laptop with good configuration,5,"It is very good laptop with good configuration in reasonable price. I was facing some problem with pre-installed window 11 OS. Anyway I didn't have any plans to use window OS. So reformatted the laptop and install Linux Mint. Now it is working like a charm. And for day to day work, using Libre office which is equally good compared to MS office atleast for day to day work. The warranty was showing only 6 months which able to correct to 1 year by calling HP customer support."

HP AMD Ryzen 5,Jeetendra G,Amazing value for money and HP Trust,5,"This laptop never fails to amuse me! It has an amazing AMD Ryzen 5500U processor with 6 cores and 12 threads coupled with an AMD Radeon Vega 7 (if I am not wrong) both the processor and GPU share the system memory, but that's ok. 8 GB RAM at 3200 MHz is superfast. 512 GB SSD, so the read and write speed is fast. I use this laptop for computer graphics, photo editing, video editing, web designing using WordPress and MS Office and it works like a charm. I have edited 4K videos using this laptop and the processor just zooms past and completes the rendering within minutes. There is no lag even, when I am scrubbing the videos. The keyboard is butter smooth. The touch pad is smooth like an ice skating rink. The laptop comes with HP additional software which makes setting it up very easy. Fast charging battery. Backup is 4 to 6 hours depending on your usage. Hey HP don't read my review and increase the price of such good products, instead keep it the same or make it affordable for people."

JBL Go 3,Atharva Patwardhan,Punchy bass for a pocket sized small speaker,5,"I had a JBL Go 1 that I used for almost 6 years before it wore out. Went with this one since it looked a bit more rugged and portable with the braided loop. Pros: 1. Great bass. Compared to the Go 1, this has around 40% more volume and bigger, thumpier bass. So all pop songs are a pleasure to the ear. 2. Rich sound. Songs with vocals are crisp and clear, with a certain richness to it. Arijit Singh fans will love this one. 3. Battery: I tested this for around 4 days, playing songs continuously on 70-80% volume and it lasted a good ~4 hours. Safe to say it will go around 5 to 6 hours easily on 50-60% volume. 4. Has type-C USB port for charging, so can be charged with yiur ohone charger. Will update on charging speeds in a while. 5. Good connectivity. Does not get stutters and lag even when playing from different rooms. Max range is about 20-30 ft though, so go beyond that and it will distort and stutter like hell. 6. Controls are great. The speaker gets 3 buttons on the top. Two for controlling volume and a play/pause/next track/previous track button. Buttons are clicky and feel good to press unlike the previous generations where you couldn't tell if the button was pressed due to lack of feedback. Cons: 1. No AUX port. Idk why they did this. An AIX port would've enabled me to even use this as my desktop speaker without BT. Doesn't matter much but the previous JBL Go's had the AUX, so I'd gotten used to playing from it occasionally. 2. No mic. Again, idk why they did this. The previous generations had a mic. Not much of a con though because I never really used these for calls. Overall, if you don't need an AUX speaker and can live without a mic on it, go for this one. Absolute no-brainer and bang-for-a-buck speaker. Tip: If you have a Samsung phone, enable Dolby Atmos for even punchier bass and richer sound."
JBL Go 3,Jbl is jbl,Bass,5,"I recently purchased the JBL GO 3 from Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. This speaker offers exceptional sound quality at an unbeatable price, making it the best speaker in its budget range. From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by its compact and stylish design. It's incredibly portable, which makes it perfect for taking on the go. Despite its small size, the JBL GO 3 delivers powerful and clear sound, with impressive bass for such a compact device. The build quality is top-notch. It feels sturdy and well-made, with a durable fabric material that provides a great grip and adds to its rugged feel. Plus, it's waterproof and dustproof (IP67 rated), so I don't have to worry about using it outdoors or by the pool. Pairing the speaker with my devices was quick and hassle-free, thanks to Bluetooth 5.1. The battery life is also commendable, offering up to 5 hours of playtime on a single charge, which is more than enough for my needs. Overall, the JBL GO 3 has exceeded my expectations in every way. Its a fantastic little speaker that punches well above its weight, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly portable speaker."

JBL Go 3,Rohit,Great tiny speaker! Love it.,4,"The media could not be loaded. I've been using my JBL Go 2 for the past 5 years, it still works, that too.. without any distortion! So I knew Go 3 will be as good, if not better. Love the design! Sound is great for its compact size. Edit: Taking one star off because the function of 'pressing-the-play-button-three-times-to-go-to-the-previous-track' just won't work! Doesn't matter how fast I click the button, it'll go to next track (double click) and pause (third click) the playback! Not a very big issue, but it doesn't happen on my Go 2."

JBL Go 3,Fayis M.,Best product,4,"The build quality is very nice. The durability is good, like i can take it any atmospheric condition.I didnt expect this much sound and bass from this small product.

JBL Go 3,M MANOJ,Loud but not sharp,4,Product build quality is excellent. But this speaker has too much bass. It is good for listening to loud music not crisp music. The vocals are very blurred like someone speaking from inside a cave or underwater. There is hardly any sharpness to the vocals which makes watching dailogue heavy content almost painful. Most of the words are lost to the bass. I tried changing the audio setting from stereo to mono but no improvement. And it is sad because every other JBL product I have has a brilliant audio quality - perfect balance between bass &amp; treble.

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Nirajkumar,Prestige Sandwich Maker - A Compact Powerhouse for Quick and Healthy Meals,5,"I recently added the Prestige 800W Sandwich Maker (PGMFD 01) to my kitchen, and it has quickly become a game-changer for preparing quick and delicious meals. The sleek black design, coupled with the heat-resistant Bakelite body, gives it a modern and durable feel that complements any kitchen decor. One of the standout features of this sandwich maker is its powerful 800W heating element. It heats up quickly, allowing for speedy meal preparation. Whether I'm making grilled cheese sandwiches, paninis, or stuffed wraps, this appliance delivers consistent and even heating, ensuring a perfectly toasted result every time. The non-stick coating on the cooking plates is a major plus. Not only does it prevent the food from sticking, making the cleaning process a breeze, but it also promotes oil-free toasting. This feature aligns with modern dietary preferences, allowing for healthier meal options without compromising on taste. The compact size of the Prestige Sandwich Maker makes it ideal for small kitchens or those with limited counter space. Its vertical storage capability is an added convenience, allowing it to be tucked away neatly when not in use. The lightweight design makes it easy to handle and move around as needed. The inclusion of power indicators is a thoughtful touch. The indicator lights clearly signal when the sandwich maker is preheating and ready for use. This feature eliminates any guesswork, ensuring that I can start cooking at the optimal temperature for the best results. Using the Prestige Sandwich Maker is a straightforward process. The hinged lid accommodates various sandwich thicknesses, and the lockable handle ensures a secure closure during cooking. The result is perfectly sealed sandwiches with evenly toasted bread and melted fillings. In terms of value for money, the Prestige 800W Sandwich Maker delivers on both performance and affordability. It combines a powerful heating element, non-stick convenience, and a sleek design at a competitive price point. In conclusion, the Prestige 800W Sandwich Maker (PGMFD 01) is a reliable and efficient addition to any kitchen. Its compact size, powerful heating element, and user-friendly features make it a standout choice for individuals or families looking to create quick and healthy toasted meals. I highly recommend this sandwich maker for its performance, ease of use, and value for money."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Sarim Ahmed,Go for it!,5,"I bought this sandwich maker a few months ago and I am very happy with it. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and makes delicious sandwiches in minutes. The non-stick coating ensures that the bread does not stick to the plates and the heat-resistant bakelite body prevents any burns. The power indicators show when the sandwich maker is ready to use and when the sandwiches are done. The cord length is also sufficient for me to place it anywhere in the kitchen. The sandwich maker has a durable die-cast aluminum grill plate that can toast up to two sandwiches at a time. The grill plate has a German technology greblon non-stick coating that allows oil-free toasting and reduces the fat intake. The sandwiches come out crispy and evenly browned, with the cheese and fillings melted perfectly. I have tried making different kinds of sandwiches with this sandwich maker, such as cheese, vegetable, chicken, paneer, and even pizza sandwiches. They all turned out great and my family loved them. The sandwich maker is also easy to clean and maintain. The non-stick coating makes it easy to wipe off any crumbs or cheese residue with a damp cloth. The sandwich maker also has a lockable lid that keeps the plates closed and prevents any spillage. The sandwich maker is compact and lightweight, and can be stored vertically or horizontally. It also has a cool touch handle that makes it easy to carry and open. Overall, I am very satisfied with this sandwich maker and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sandwiches. It is a great product from Prestige, a trusted brand in kitchen appliances. It is worth the price and offers good value for money. It is also a good gift option for your friends and family."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,KUHELI CHAKRABORTY SENGUPTA,SATISFIED,5,"Very handy product worth buying everything is perfect but the cord length is very short which makes it difficult to keep it in the kitchen which is not equipped with sockets. It has been a long time I have been using it not a single issue up till now.For cleaning just wipe it off with a damp cloth and it's done... depending on what u have grilled.... cheese is difficult to remove so cleane it when the griller is still warm after removing the plug. It gets clean easily.I have been using similar sandwich maker since last 10 years but of different brand.i wanted to buy a new one for Diwali and this is really nice.Value for money!looks are also good,heating is adequate to make crisp sandwiches.Go for it.Very satisfied with the product. The cord length is just perfect and pretty easy to clean just need to wipe with a cloth. It perfectly grills the sandwich and I have used it a lot of time to grill vegetables it works amazingly. Also, prestige is a very trust worthy conpany so already was expecting good quality. Would recommend if you are looking for a grill sandwich maker.Really I liked this product from Prestige... sandwich gets cooked evenly... will not burns the bread... you can easily check the sandwich or toast easily by opening the lid in between to check for the burns.....Cord length is about 1 meter &amp; it is ok for the kitchen top near the switch board....Very easy to clean....Before cleaning make sure to switch off the maker &amp; remove the cord... let the maker to get cooled completely &amp; Just wipe off the leftovers with a wet cloth to remove the butter stains &amp; clean it with tissue paper finally... &amp; here you go once again with a brand new sandwich maker....Make sure to clean the maker after every use so that it keeps the maker odour free...."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Bandhu Prasad Aleyamma,Perfect for quick sandwiches,5,"I have been using it for the last couple of months. Its a quick sandwich maker. Working well with cooked meat, non cooked veg (cucumber, tomato etc.) and butter, jam and gulakand. According to the stuffed items it takes two to three minutes to get a decent grilled sandwich. One has to use a 'pakad' to get the sandwich out. Also make sure you wait for 10 mnts before starting to clean the inside of the grill."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Vidya Mohan,I am indeed impressed with the product. It is very handy,5,"I am moving to UK and I needed something handy and quick to cook equipment and I think this is perfect as it takes less time to cook and clean after. It is also perfect for temporary stays where you don have a kitchen with your room as this requires only a plug point and no gas etc. it is way lesss messier than a pan to cook as well. Overall, I recommend it"

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Dinesh,Great Sandwich Maker with Convenient Features!,4,"I recently purchased the Prestige 800W Sandwich Maker (PGMFD 01) in black, and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. The sandwich maker offers a range of convenient features that make toasting sandwiches a breeze. The heat-resistant bakelite body is a great addition, ensuring that the outer surface remains cool to the touch during operation. This is especially useful when you have kids around. The non-stick coating on the plates works like a charm; my sandwiches slide out effortlessly, and cleaning up is a breeze. The power indicators are a small but handy feature. They let me know exactly when the sandwich maker is ready for use and when my sandwiches are perfectly toasted. It's a great way to avoid any guesswork. One of the standout features for me is the oil-free toasting option. I appreciate being able to enjoy crispy, delicious sandwiches without the need for excessive oil. It's a healthier option that doesn't compromise on taste. While I've had a positive experience overall, I'm giving this product 4 stars because I've noticed that the toasting can be a bit uneven at times. However, with a little adjustment and experimentation, I've been able to find the sweet spot for consistently golden-brown sandwiches. In summary, the Prestige 800W Sandwich Maker is a valuable addition to any kitchen. Its heat-resistant body, non-stick plates, power indicators, and oil-free toasting option make it a user-friendly and health-conscious choice. Despite a minor quibble with even toasting, I'm thoroughly satisfied with my purchase. (Note: This review is based on my personal experience and opinions with the product. Your mileage may vary.)"

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Saurabh Kundu,Nice Grill and Sandwich maker.,4,"I love my Prestige Sandwich Maker! It has a good build and finish, and it makes great sandwiches and sometimes burgers too. The only thing you have to be careful about is the handle, which gets hot while in use. You also have to avoid touching the surface when it's on because it can cause severe burn injuries. I bought it for myself after my old gas stove sandwich maker broke, and I'm glad I did. The cord length is about half a metre, which is enough for me. There is no manual temperature control, but that's not a problem for me. It's very easy to clean, as long as nothing gets burned while preparing. I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves sandwiches!"

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,pswarup,Good wuality and it's Non Stick quality..,4,This is good product. Non stick quality stays for long. The size is the problem . Caution to use is dont fill lot of material . You cant fit big size (Sandwich Size ) Slice. ALso the Depth is small hence you cant fill lot of material. The top cover quality is not great.In my case it is broken when pressed extra. I have previusly used Bajaj which was so bad I have to throw it away in 6 months as it's non stick quote come out soon. While this prodcut is great and makes my grilled sandwitch in no time.

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Manjula A,Small wonder.,4,"I was craving for some cheese sandwiches but wasn't comfortable ordering online during pandemic. Tava toasted sandwiches doesn't give you the feel. So went for this one. Does the job pretty well. Used it twice and no complaints. Here's what you need to know before you decide to buy: Con: 1.You can only make one sandwich at a time and you can't put too much stuffing. If this is not a concern then go for it. 2. Like others have mentioned, the cord is not very long but not too short. 3feet long approximately. Pros: 1.Take less than a minute to pre heat and and also to toast. 2. Easy to clean, handle and store 3. Has temperature control and indicators. How to use: 1. Switch on the toaster, the red light will be on indicating it is pre heating 2. Wait for a min or so, the green light will be on which means it is preheated and you can place your bread in it. 3. Smear butter or oil on both the plates and place your sandwich with filling inside it and close it. 4. The green light will go off and goes on in intervals by which it controls the temperature. It does not mean your sandwich is done. You got to check for yourself. It usually takes 30-40 sec so you can check accordingly. 4. When you feel the bread is toasted enough you can remove your sandwich, reapply butter and toast another. You don't have to switch off the main switch untill you are done with toasting all the bread you want. Oh .. and you can toast left over roti as well."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Kalpna Kumari,temparature controll is needed,4,"it's a very nice product even though the temperature control is not that great you have to preheat it before the cord is too big for my liking but it's fine there are some cons its top gets very heated when u are using it,u have to preheat it, it takes time to cool which is a big thing overall product is fit 7/10 would recommend so it would be 5 stars if it had nice temperature control the grill overall is nice but they could improve and a huge thing the lights given above it turn red and yellow it should be green since yellow means waiting and stuff and in the beginning I thought the same thing and my sandwich burned the wires at the back get heated up as well which can cause fire and is dangerous"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Meet sheth,Good product,4,It is an good product but size is too small as per I see on a photo I can't put more then one bread in toster other than all things are good to use and safe
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Chatoireviews,Seven samurai,4,"I have had the privilege of having my fill of morning (psst irrespective of time of any manner) energy booster using this sandwich maker (one of the many chores it possess) and I am convinced that it does its job what it is assigned for in like 10 seconds, literally. More than that and boom its burned unless you like having it burned (you do you) oh yes, and I am talking about bread toast here. Simple butter, cheese combination bread toast. People have written reviews with attached pictures declaring that this machine right here can even grill your chicken strips, I am ready to raise my green flag on this since I am quite happy with the product. I will try some day to manoeuvre other dishes than just my BT if (slanted) I live another day. Till then, be my guest and bring food for me, asking ardently."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Salim Hirani,Use gently. Open and close slowly. Let it cool bfr you clean it with a soft cloth .,4,"Cooks / grills very quickly, coz of its power. Makes two sandwiches very easily without a problem. Just make sure that the upper slice of bread is a little towards the back, coz when the lid is closed , due to the lid pressure the bread slice moves forward ( I cook a lot , so I know what I am talking about ) Happy Healthy, quick and easy sandwiches. Enjoy"

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Hitheswaron,A griller for common man,4,"First, before looking into this, I was searching for a sandwich maker as mine went poofff!!;(. I saw many products but felt they are overpriced or not from a well known brand. When I came across the name griller, I though why not go for this as it can accommodate more than a sandwich maker and the variety is more in it. The cheapest one was from Prestige and I immediately ordered it as I have good experience with Prestige kitchen products and they really last well. The griller is small and can accommodate around 2 medium sized breads or a large sandwich bread. The griller heats up really well and there is no setting sort of thing. Just put it in and take it out when you want. Just one mistake I did, used a steel tongs, which scratched off the non-stick paint. The cable is not very long enough but manageable with a stool or book. The non-stick works really well and wiping it is a joy. Thank you.:)"

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Fatema Zohra,"Not bad, Prestige is a brand",4,"This is an ok product. Good for sliced bread toasting. Cord length is less than one meter, better you use an extension cable. But remember, you need to heat first till. Simply switch on the machine (red light) and wait till green light. Than put two breads at a time (single bread wont be toasted properly) for some time, then open and reset it again inner side outside to make it both side toasted. Otherwise it will be toasted only outer part. Time management is important otherwise your bread will become crispy chips, hahahaha Photo taken after 20 use. One star deducted because of inner part paint removal."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,veerendra,Good sandwich maker.,4,The built quality is fine . Heats up pretty quickly. It would have been better if it was of bit higher wattage si that it could generate more heat and mkre quickly. Note: i received bit damaged product. A piece of plastic of outer body was broken and fallen in the box. I didn't return as it waste of time and energy but works without any issue. You can get it replaced based on Amazon return policy .

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Amazon Customer,Good,4,Value for money
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,YM,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!,4,"IT'S DECENT VALUE FOR MONEY. The Cord lenght could have been a little longer as this is very inconvenient sometimes. Wonder why appliance manufacturers do such stupid mistakes and scrimp and scrounge on the stupidest things like 'Cord lenght'... Besides the cord length, it's a little on the lighter side also. Needs to be made solid like the George Foreman GRILL. Other than that it's ok for the price you pay. Can't expct much from these penny wise and pound foolish manufacturers, but then the Indian market is also stingy and price sensitive. So over all you get what you pay for....."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Ravi Vasudeva,Build quality needs improvement,3,I purchased this a month back and it has been functioning satisfactorily. The issue I have with this product is of build quality. While there is a claim by the manufacturer that this model has improved structural strength and good non stick coating I here beg to disagree.If there was indeed an improvement in the structural quality I wonder what it was like before. Also I was very careful not to use any metal or any hard material on the non stick surface by always using wooden spoon to remove the sandwitch and I have cleaned it just with wet cloth still I find sratches on the non stick coating exposing the shiny aluminium. I did notice how thin was the non stick coating. It much touted German ansestory is nothing but a joke.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Anish,Green LED placement has some design flaw,3,"Product is good and woring fine. But the green LED indicator which shows the toast is ready is not properly visible, it's a design flaw as it's next to the red light. Buy some other model, brand"

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Amazon Customer,Prestige sandwitch maker,3,"Received product in good packaging but the quality of product is average. The handle is very low and pressing hard will make it damaged. another point is ,User manual is saying that when sand witches are ready then green indicator will on but my case , it is yellow indicator.I am expecting this light to be green like red one or as mentioned in user manual . I am not sure if this is manufacturing defect or something that user can accept."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,MILTON,Ok ok product,3,Ok ok product
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Placeholder,Quality issues,3,"The unit looks pretty ok but the black plastic is just inadequate. I received the item broken inside with the package intact. Suggesting that it either broke during transportation wherein it fell down on hard surface multiple times or the more obvious thing that the packing personnel mishandled the item and it fell down during packing and it was packed anyway for compromising customers. The bottom-line is that the plastic is brittle and breaks easily. This damage can happen even during use when it may be dropped accidentally. Plastic pieces inside the recover box were sharp and tiny and could easily hurt children. I've requested for a replacement, and of it is received in good condition, I'll look forward to the usage part of the item. 3 stars for a seemingly high quality revised version of this product. 1 star more if it is received in good condition and performs well. Fingers crossed."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Krutartha Sahoo,Nice product to buy under 1300,3,The product is of the good brand so you can bank on buying this product if you want to make some sandwiches at home and get yourself the tag of chef. - The length of the cord is will be small so need to careful with the usage. - The temperature is well controlled and it has an indicator to it. - The clean is bit difficult to have and need to be cleaned before the next use otherwise you will have an issue with the stink and over cooked.

Taste of sandwich maker from this toaster is not that good. Product recieved in good quality no defect is found. Price should be lower if the product is like this. I got a little shock from this product so I am returning it. but overall product is average. I am making a Returning query for this product today(2nd July 2020)"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Nirjharini Saha,Cost effective (Edit: Not long-lasting),3,Quite satisfied with the product. It is easy to handle and also very convenient because it takes less time to toast/cook. Got nice grill marks (see picture) in the first sandwich I made with it. (Edit: Decreased rating from 5 to 3 stars. The non-stick coating in the grill plates came off couple of days back and my sandwich got all burnt. It has not even completed 2 years of usage. Product from Prestige was expected to last longer. Disappointed with the experience.)
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,StayAnonymous,Safety concern due to mild electric shock while using this product,3,"if your kids are going to use this product, be aware you would get mild electric shock while using this grill. I have experienced twice and confirmed this issue. Also my house is well secured with proper earthing and used a genuine extension box with surge protected to use this grill. Due to this mild shock I am giving the rating '3' for this product. So I have to switch off the power every time to check on the sandwich whether it is cooked or not. Another 2 points : =&gt; Grill exterior body is made of very cheap plastic. (Prestige, you have lost the 'prestige' of brand value) =&gt; Confusing Power on Red/Green button and puzzles you what kind of engineering behind this. Pros : Yes. you can make sandwich as the product claims."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,KALAPI,Not quite good,3,"I had purchased this when my Borosil sandwich maker crashed. But this was a total disappointment. Though it says it has space for two sandwiches (4breads) in reality, if you are using sandwich breads, then only one sandwich can be made. It you use the regular breads for sandwich, then the space is congested and overlaps each other. It's better not to go for this if the family is big and you want an easy option for all in one go"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Reena,Not worth it.,3,"The sandwiches are not crispy, and it is not even easy to clean. Overall not a good experience. I shifted to a 400 rs gas sandwich toaster. That gives me 10 times better experience."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Paramjeet kaur,Small in size,3,Good for Nuclear family
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Amazon Customer,Good product,3,Over a good product easy to use..
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,drhkind,Temperature Control is Missing,3,"Because of middle locking system, Prestige Sandwich Maker has an edge over its competitors. It has a major drawback. The distribution of heat is not equal on the heating plates. Besides, it has no way to control heating either by increasing or decreasing temperature in degrees or by controlling time."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Bindumadhav Bhalerao,This Product Is Good And Easy To Work With.,3,"This Product Is Good But Does Not Match The Dimensions Mentioned In Description Of Product. But Working Wise Its Good. Makers Must Correct The Dimensions In Product Description. Length, Height &amp; Breadth Does Not Match As mentioned."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Piyush,Worst customer service by Prestige,3,Thank you Amazon for replacing item even after replacement period over. I have received totally damaged piece. Prestige has very bad customer service. They denied for service on product and blamed the Amazon for damaged piece
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Rajan Prasad Singh,Replacement request,3,"I ordered this Prestige Sandwich Maker PGMFD 01Delivered 11-Oct-2021. Delivered in perfectly fine state. I use this first time on 7th November. While switching it on after pre heat, it sparked, turned automatically off, never turned on again and upper body gets a Crack. I request hereby that please replace this product as early as possible. Regards,"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Nalneesh,Pros and cons about prestige toaster griller.,3,Good and handy product for the everyday use but one thing which is lacking about it is that it doesn't have auto cut system.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Nishint,Product is nice but lock clip is very small that's is only weakness.,3,Acha hai sandwich maker but lock karne wali clip bohot choti hai to kafi baar lock ko dwa kar pakana padhta hai
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Parag Parashar,The non stick paint seems too thin layered,3,"Overall product is good. but the non stick paint on grill plates seems to be too thin layered or something wrong there. Normally after using it, we clean with a cotton cloth. But i can see that at some places, the paint has got peeled and aluminum below it is visible. i use it almost daily one time and make sure to operate it carefully and keep it clean. Apart from this all is good but this is main. Once the paint goes away, the sandwitch will start sticking to plates.."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Mythili,Comfort,3,Good product can be used for everyday toasting and grill purpose
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Rajesh Singh,Ok,3,It's OK to use. Not much innovative. It's the same old pattern.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Amazon Customer,green light doesnt work from the start.,3,"The item received was defective. the green light doesnt blink so far. so we need to check manually if the sandwich is done or not. we didnt return the product as the lockdown is going on. otherwise it works well. heating is good. toast sandwich tastes better than normal sandwich. i recommend this type of toaster to everyone. also cord length is very small, not even 1 meter."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Priyanka,Good,3,Good
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Abhisneh,Sandwich made are awesome but the product looks feeble and will last only ...,3,"Sandwich made are awesome but the product looks feeble and will last only a year .. not expected from prestige . Sandwich making require only 3-5 minutes depends on filling, sandwiches are crispy and cheese melts completely to give good flavour. Cleaning is easy simply wipe it with clean cloth. Power Cable is too small . Why can't such companies make a longer cord, they are providing household product, these product should be user-friendly. Its such a annoying aspect. Also I think that plastic cover can melt or shag due to intense heating of coil during sandwich preparation . Also the depth between plates when it close should be a little more, so that sandwich with more fillings can be made. Also the locking mechanism look fragile"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Consumer,Not worth it.,3,"I've been using this product for a long time now and i can say it that it isn't that good. It makes sandwich bread too crispy, hard to bite."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Saif,Average product,3,"Nothing special to write home about. Doesn't feel sturdy. I'm bit scared that the closing lock may break some day it's so flimsy. Even the coating has come off in one place. Having said, so far it's doing it's job efficiently, that's grilling sandwitches."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Priyanka Chaubey,Its a so so product. Before buying any product ...,3,"Its a so so product. Before buying any product we definitely see [positive and negative reviews. For this product there are many positive reviews but there are some negative reviews which are actually correct. Yes, it is getting heated very quickly. The outer base is having messy coil arrangement and it is getting heated so be careful when you are handling it. somebody has written sandwiches are ready in seconds but its not true, it takes few miniutes atleast for pre hearing and then process of making starts. Also the picture shows a bigger image but in real its not so big. hardly you can put 2 -3 pieces sandwich style. I guess the grill plates are also not detachable so cleaning is a mess."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Amazon Customer,Make sure product is packed & not broken,3,When I received product outer packaging was Good but main Prestige box was unpacked that means it's used product delivered me and beside handle small piece was broken. Can see in pic.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Kush Badhani,Not satisfied with the packaging,3,Well product is fine but packaging was really unsatisfied. First of all the package was not covered with Amazon's package box. They gave me the item directly in its original box and it was all wet. I was afraid whether it will work or not but product was working fine.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,KVSS R Rao,Product dimensions are less compared to what is claimed in the website.,3,The product dimensions is not as mentioned. It is mentioned as 51x31x12 cms. Whereas the package dimensions in inches are different. Have I got the right product new model what is claimed. Can someone speak to me. Otherwise I will return.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Ramesh,Handle lock is broken within 10days of use,3,"body build quality is not good , its handle lock is broken within use of 10days and without handle lock you cannot manage the toaster, even I have seen lots of reviews on handle lock broken. Apart from this other things are good for sandwish &amp; toast making but again its build quality come wherein if your lock is broken then how you will manage."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Anil Thomas,"Average product, low quality material cannot stuff too much",3,"I have used it for 5 months and I can say it's outer surface is very delicate which can easily crack while locking. I don't use here brown bread as it doesn't lock properly. I use only white bread with just minimal stuffing. if you try hard to close it ,it will break.. plus point it's easy to clean and less messy."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Aman,Not Good Product,3,"Not a good product. For the grilled mark, I turned the sandwich 3-4 times. The product get so heated up but no grilled mark."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Tasha Tyson,Product is ok with little confusions,3,Like .... It's compact and worthy. Dislike ... Finishing of product at the rear side is crude and not smooth. Green light not turns on in green colour as specified in the pamphlet. Dont know if need to wait and will it show green color light. Length of Cord is not sufficient.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Raja,Dose the job but build quality can be improved,3,This toaster is good for very light usages. The build quality looks cheap. The plastic used may tend to break if you apply more pressure. Good if you going to use it only few times in a week or lesser than that. Given the build quality I highly doubt it can sustain daily moderate usages.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Saurabh,Average Product,3,"Does the work: 3 Build Quality: 2 Safety: 3 Ease of usage: 2 Cleaning: 3 Suggestion after use: Avoid preheating, it starts generating smoke. Make sure you don't rely on the automatic support of the product. Be there while using and keep checking."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Good,Na,3,Na
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Rahul R.,So-so.. avg. Stuff,3,"Yeah working well no issues But green led do not blink solo after the grilling is done,the green colour reflector is just kind for show button, instead both the led's combinely blinks continuously producing orange colour light, (after grilling is completed)which reduces it's soberness &amp; gives more kinda look like local company apparatus."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,anjali,Received damaged and used product,3,"Overall produxt is good. But I have received damaged &amp; used product. Seller pls check the product twice or thrice before shipping to customer, it's time &amp; money wasting for us ( when only replacement is possible). This is my third time issue with newly purchased Prestige Brand products. Creating a question in my mind are the sellers selling only second/ or branded defective products here?"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,The upper Handel is broken,Product is broken,3,Please replace it
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Rohan,Simple to operate but not sturdy,3,"Upper part doesn't close smoothly on the lower part, instead keeps banging on it. Cord could be longer. Thought of going for this product after reading so many reviews on Amazon. Not Happy with the product! Guess the lock would get damaged after few uses."

May be they not had quality check in this Diwali rush period. :) Anyways product returned and refund received. About Product: It's of low quality material, could get easily cracked or broken and not worth spending 1200+. It's a Prestige thing, bit highly priced, not for long run."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Amazon Customer,Good product,3,Good one
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Swati,Works but have to use very carefully,3,"In the second use the handle just fell off. No extra pressure applied, no fall, it just fell off on its own as if had been broken earlier and pasted with glue. Ordered for a replacement which came after 3 reminders. Outer packet was torn when the replacement came but thankfully product was in good condition. Sandwiches are easy to make and tastes good. But smoke coming out during use is more than what I had seen in the first product. Will decide in the next 3-4 uses whether to keep it or return it for good."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Placeholder,Works faster,3,Material used for infrastructure is less quantity handle with care but electrical system is good to give quick result

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Sanc,Wrong information,3,"Wrong information regarding 1.5MTR cable, it's only 1MTR rest fine but design from rear is too bas, but it hardly matters as you don't look it from the back, finishing is poor"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Mohit P.,Does the job,3,"Does the Job, but lock is poorly designed, it cannot be locked after putting sandwich inside. You have to hold it with hand."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Somnath De,Good but not like Philphs.,3,I like the mat finish. However the heaters are not fully covered. You can burn your fingers if not handled with care. Be careful while holding it from sides. Apart from that it is a nice product. It heats well and quickly.

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Saswati,It's not fully nonstick.,2,Need to take out sandwiches carefully otherwise the coating will be lost n it will stick to the breads while doing next time. More over product is good but I would say use silicon spatula to take out hot sandwiches if we use plastic or steel metal the coating will be gone.

The plate fittings also wasn't sturdy"

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,sai prasad,Backside it has broken,2,Got a damaged product
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Geet C,Small size and poor design,2,The product is small in size. The photo shown in the product with 2 sandwiches side by side is misleading. Two regular bread sandwiches side by side do not fit in this grill. The lock does not close even with a single two slice sandwich with just basic vegetable stuffing. Your sandwich will not be crisp even with pre-heating and running two power heating cycles. Very poor design and the quality of the plastic is also cheap. The coating on the grill plates is poor too.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,This fake product of Wonderchef. Please do not buy. Its better offline lelo ya direct website se. Sab chor hai amazon pr saale,Not make crispy at one time. I need to heat 2-3 times.,2,Not make crispy at one time. I need to heat 2-3 times.

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Amit Agrawal,Doesn't serve the purpose,2,"A normal expectation from the sandwich maker is to have a crisp golden brown sandwich but this one fails here. Fumes starts to come in 1 min, by that time the sandwich is already burnt. One cannot wait for the auto timer else the sandwich will be burnt and will become non-edible. Overall it doesn't bring in the results I was looking for. Tawa sandwich is better than this."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Usha Nagarajan,Very small,2,This model can only accommodate small sized breads! You cannot even make two sandwiches using large sized breads ! And one cannot good amount of stuffings! The clamp for closing is so weak(like plastic) and does not close well!
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,"Suresh, Cochin",Didn't like the quality,2,Returned same day. Bought because of the brand name. But this looks very cheap. Bought wipro and using it past 6 months.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Sriram P.,"Difficult to close, lid broke",2,"This lid cracked within a few months and we are somehow managing by filling it with Feviquik. It has always been very difficult to close if you have normal size bread and put little stuffing in it - we just put cheese, sauce and jalapenos and sometimes both my wife and I have to close it together, with one clamping the two ends and the other flipping the latch. The latch is also flimsy and I am afraid it won't last long. Not buying this again. Since the plates are not removable, it is not that easy to clean. Bought this 7 months ago."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Abdul Gafoor,NOT SO GOOD,2,"We used this for around one month. It's a below-average sandwich maker. There is no heating control /temperature monitor outside the unit except an indicator light. This light sets off / on without any control. Most of the time the bread inside gets overheated and couldn't eat. As such we need to turn off the unit and to open the lid without waiting for the indicator turns to be green. Also, residues are precipitated over the plates which turn to be some white patches that cannot be cleaned or removed. Overall this model is not a recommended one."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Charu Dixit,Too many drawbacks,2,I ordered this after seeing good reviews. But I am disappointed now. It's been only 10 days and after a couple of used the black / non stick coating is coming off. This is despite following all cleaning instructions and using only wooden spatula for this. Also the other issues are : Length of cord is small There is no on/off button. We have to operate directly from plug Body is not sturdy and looks cheap plastic Gets heated up and starts fuming Overall not satisfied with the purchase
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Abhilash Pandey,This product is not at all non stick,2,"This is not a good product, This product is not at all non stick, and it's got burnt today. The body is also weak and got damage while I was trying to put the sandwich for grill."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Dhruv Srivastava,Disappointed,2,"Pros: It's not anything special as far as toasters go Cons: - Sandwiches come out relatively soggy. My 11 year old toaster makes crispier sandwiches. I knew at the time of buying that these new toasters have issues keeping the sandwiches crispy but I was hoping that this being the reliable Prestige brand, it might be different. Alas, I was wrong. - The much advertised non-stick coating is already coming off, it's not been a full month since we started using it and we use it VERY occasionally. This was not expected from Prestige. An overall average/okay-ish toaster but I worry about the non-stick coating."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Emmanuel Ratnaraj,Disappointed,2,The grilling frame is smaller than expected so only small sized bread slices will fit in it.

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,sanju,Damaged,1,Received damaged product
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Placeholder,A surprisingly bad product from Prestige,1,"When I bought this product, it was after a bad experience from a similar product from Amazon basics in which the sandwich was only cooking from corners and was raw in centre. Replacement for that was not even turning on. After that bad experience, I decided to place my trust in Prestige. It was a bad decision. Cooking was alright but quality wise it was a bad product. Maybe my experience was unique, as there were many good reviews for it. I was very surprised when even after following the cleaning and maintenance instructions to the letter, after only 3-4 uses, the non stick coating started to come out in chips. I expected a better product from a brand like Prestige. Bad Product. Not recommended."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Amazon Customer,Extremely disappointing item,1,Delivered just a few days over a month have used it only twice but the Teflon coating has already come off in small and slightly large points all over the bottom plate I have personally with good care always cleaned it this sort of useless product from a prestigious company like prestige is very disappointing kindly arrange immediate refund Also an explanation from both Amazon and Prestige is due for such poor product Before this I was using Bajaj sandwich maker for years
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Srinivas Ambaram,Received faulty product,1,"I have received faulty product and I exchange the product , but I did not received the new product and show as delivered"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Yogesh,Cheap product. Did not expect this from Prestige brand,1,The media could not be loaded. Total waste of money. Purchased on 17th Jan delivered on 19th Jan 2022 and in just 3 use the coating started peeling off. I can never imagine Prestige can go such cheap on products. So please do not waste your precious money on such product. You check the photos &amp; video published. The non stick coating can be easily scratched by your finger nails so just wow on this product quality testing team and kudos to the makers of this product. It should be negative ratings on 5hia product and unfortunately I have to give atleaat 1 star. Cord is really small so you have to use extension in kitchen. Heating really takes time to make the sandwich crisp. Better to toast on the gas instead of using this peiece of crap.
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Kshitij,Waste of money,1,Very bad lock is faulty and also the cord it would not last for 3-4 times use. Very poor quality
