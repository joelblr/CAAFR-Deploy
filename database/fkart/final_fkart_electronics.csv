Prestige PIC 20,Animesh Sen,Overall good product,4,"very good product.Well designed, heat controllable easy to use.But for only one reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars, that is its side material of the body is not very good, it should be more heavy.It may brake due to rough use.But it totally depends on you.If you take care of it and use it gently, then it's okk.So don't think too much and just order it. delivered early to me (Sarupathar, Golaghat District, Assam)"

JBL Go 3,Pushan Barman,Must buy!,5,OMG! This speaker is a wonder thing at this price. Such a good balance of low and high even on the maximum level of sound. Blue color looks dope! I know there are other brands as well with higher watt speakers but this one won't let you down if you're looking for something which is versatile and can go to places where no other speaker can then go for JBL GO 3 without a second thought.
JBL Go 3,Shyam Krishna S,Terrific purchase,5,What a product!!! Backup says 5hrs.. Its been 6.5 hrs with sound @75% still its seems enough juice is there.. Absolutely worth if you are a quality listener.. Otherwise just go for any boom box.. Pay for the quality

There may be so many Bluetooth speakers these days with thumping bass etc. But JBL has got an amazing sound quality, to me which is the most Important feature. Whats the use of huge Bass without the quality, crispness and true sound notes. Sound is very very Loud, bass is good, Sound quality is great !! Light weight, super Handy and effortlessly portable. Go without any thought!!"

JBL Go 3,Vivek Thimothy,Simply awesome,5,I'm writing this review the day I got this product. So far excellent!! I was definitely impressed with the sound quality. The bass is also superb and vibrant. I liked the design and the product feels like it's made up of good quality. Definitely not heavy. It's very portable. The connectivity is really fast too (I think it's because it has the latest Bluetooth version as of now). But the one thing I hate about this thing is that when you are listening to music with this and the volume is full...
JBL Go 3,Senthil Raja,Delightful,4,"I had been using JBL GO for almost 4 years. It is still working. Upgraded to JBL GO3. Initially I did not like it so much. But as I kept using it, I now find it is good. It has better bass then JBL GO. I still like JBL GO when listening in very very low volumes. Maybe I am used to the sound of GO. I am also using Sony xb20. Cannot compare JBL GO3 to XB20 as they are at different price point and XB20 has much better sound quality. However JBL GO3 has good sound quality in its own way."

JBL Go 3,Amalraj Sp,Simply awesome,5,It's my first experience with JBL.i was confused to buy the speaker at first.but after checking out the reviews i came to order this one. Don't expect a loud beast ear breaking sound... This is for the PPL who wish to hear music with super crystal clear sound and it will produce only minimum level of sound Bass is the beast thing inside Batter backup is excellent Portability is the main advantage. Am not statisfied with the price because as compared to the price we can buy another speakers...

Cons: -Very short power cord. -Space between both flaps closed, is very less, so your sandwich becomes very thin. -NO TEMPERATURE CONTROL, WORKS ON STANDARDIZE TEMPERATURE. Rest all is good. All in all good product in this price range. And great service by Flipkart. Cheers!!!!!!!!!!"

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Avishek Banerjee,good product,5,"i am using this product for one week, this product is very good at this price level. the sandwiches are coming out crisp and perfectly grilled, and it is very easy to clean, if cant afford a rs.3500 snacks bar level sandwich maker. go for this one. at a time 2 sandwiches can be made."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Sandhya Ojha,Pretty good,4,"Product is as expected and shown in picture. I am wring this review after two days use. Connecting wire is short but works fine within kitchen racks. Grilling plates are big enough to have two slices of breads together. Grilling is quick and hardly takes 1-2 mins for medium grill. Finally, happy with purchase."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,mb mathew,not bad,4,"pros 1 automatic timer works well. for instance, if m making sandwich it will heat for a lot longer than it will for eggs 2 Ya u read me correct, its making awesome eggs too :D. but be alarmed! making eggs will peel out the non-sticky layer. cons: 1 wire is too short not even one proper meter. 2 not big enough for large sized breads."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,praveenraj,good one worth buying it,5,"A good product from Prestige, works efficiently. Body gets heat up though, but handle remains ok. Heating is good, auto cut works well. Overall a good product for daily use. Delivery by flipkart was quick and safe as always!!"
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Daipayan Das,Decent but could be better,3,"After using this for a couple of months, I am penning this review. This is a decent product but wish it was better. The non stick surface is easy to get scratches. The surfaces are not aligned properly and so the grilling is not consistent across. While these are not deal breakers, Prestige should roll out better products."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Flipkart Customer,Fabulous!,5,v. good
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,subhro,does the job perfectly,4,"best part of the product is grill plates, but need to use them carefully. i would recommend people to use a wooden spatula to take the food out of the plates as the non stick plates are very sensitive. the product does not have a timer facility or auto off facility, though there are two indicators which does not give accurate timing. overall i love using this product. its pretty easy to use."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Sunaina Agarwal,awesome product,4,it is a very good product with straight grill plates i know ppl say straight grills plates r not good but it is awesome not only sandwich u can grill nything it makes awesome grills &amp; not at all it makes the sandwich look like grill two slice capacity awesome in a price like that and flipkart delivery as ususual awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee........

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Kunal M,VALUE for MONEY,4,"A valued product and brand. As always, Prestige has met my expectations. The thick Teflon coating prevents your sandwich to get burnt easily. Great product to use unless you're busy watching your favorite AD in TV. Cons: Do not expect a Microwave type Buzzer to remind you that your food is ready. So basically you get what you pay for. Thumbs up from my end."

Tried beaf steak, it took some time to cook. But it got cooked properly. Tried chicken steak, it took some time to cook. But it got cooked properly. The power code is little small. Other wise product is nice."

Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Aswath R,The best machine for starters!,5,"While thinking of buying a sandwich maker, I had already made up my mind to buy a basic model.After browsing a few, I came across this one. Just One word to describe its durability-'Awesome' It takes a few seconds to preheat after that, its jets on! Very fast and convenient. One amazing product, worth every penny. Note: The space between the grills is narrow. Don't try to overload contents, the result will be nothing fatal but just a little extra effort to clean up the mess. ;) HIGH FIVE t..."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Ankita Mahanta,Value for Money,5,"About the Sandwich maker : portable, light weighted, quick heating, sandwich is ready in just 5 mins. Grill option is coming out good. Overall a good product at this price. I am fully satisfied with my purchase."
Sandwich Toaster Prestige,Akash Gaur,Express Delivery,5,As expected I got my delivery within 2 days. I ordered this product on 17th evening and got the delivery on 19th morning. Hats off to flipkart.
