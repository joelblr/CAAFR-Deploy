There couldn't possibly be a better title for this book. Truly the psychology of money. Please note that many of the topics are about stock market investments.

The Psychology of Money,Pooja Gupta,Worth the money,4,"My expectations were to learn another person's point of view on money. In this book, the author is emphasizing on having your own goals, don't follow someone with other goals than you, compounding is been emphasized a lot (which is important). I won't go deep with this. Just one thing, this is just author's views and don't get manipulated with them. All in all this is a good read with metaphors for you to enjoy while reading."

But the book I received had dirty and crumpled covers, edges were bent. The packaging was also poorly done. one corner was torn when I received it.

Sapiens,Flipkart Customer,Awesome,5,Yuval takes us through a marvelous journey which makes to think twice about our acts. Many of your previous believes and promises of future will be shattered.

Sapiens,Jagadeesh s,Terrific,5,words can't describe the brilliance of this book...a lot of opinions made in this book are of course the interpretations of the author(backed up by a mother load of references) but the sheer mastery of the language with which he explains such complex concepts with simple words and analogies makes the book appealing to a wide variety of readers.

Like today, the book '21 lessons for the 21st century' has been priced from Rs 469 to Rs 612. A clarification for the same would be appreciated. What I mean to say, explanation of the lower/ higher price is expected. Is it because of the original/ duplicate copy or because of something different.

Sapiens is a mesmerising tale of 'US'-the human being.The readers might not find all the answers lying deep beneath the unturned pages of history but they surely will get to discover the beauty and vastness of human existence,the pros and cons of some of the major revolutions,and above all they will learn the art of questioning,which is,in my opinion,is the sign of a powerful book.With his point-to-point analysis and a marvellous perspective towards History, Author Ha..."
Sapiens,Flipkart Customer,Decent product,3,"You know there are some rare books which explain the reality of human species &amp; past, Myths, which we have created, science, Evolution of Humans. There will be no sugar-coated words of gods, religions, myths (Which I find in many recent books). There will be an only reality in this book. So at this point some people maybe find this book as a pessimistic. But for other people (Like Me) will find this book as a realistic. So if you wanna some realistic words of the history of the species which ..."

Sapiens,Sanadh Srivastava,Excellent,5,"I bought it thinking it will give me more insight into human behaviour and how it has developed over the years. However, this book is more like all chapters of history compiled in one book written philosophical language. Its a good read, but its a boring one. I left it at about 150 pages and now I just read it when I am totally free. Its a little over hyped."

Sapiens,Flipkart Customer,Terrific,5,Extremely good book that gives you a true insight about evolution. It provides an elaborate explanation from the time sapiens started to travel and now . Nonetheless to be honest it shows the cruelty of human race and the mass destructions of other animals we have caused . It is a good read .

Told through the prism of a 'successful' law-year, this is an excellent example of how a 'successful' life can go awry and how to avoid the pitfalls of such a life.

Do people of faith follow every religious duty commanded in the book? No. It goes the same. Buy a science book or read literature, history or buy good music instead. This is from my experience of buying spiritual self help books. It's all hogwash and preying on stupidity of the gullible."
